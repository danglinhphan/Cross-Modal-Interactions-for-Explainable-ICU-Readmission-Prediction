IMPORTANT NOTE FOR GITHUB PUSH
==============================

To prevent "File too large" errors (GitHub Limit: 100MB), the following files are ignored by .gitignore:
- `ebm_final_glassbox_ensemble.pkl` (~170MB)
- `Baselines/ebm_clinical_only.pkl`
- `Baselines/ebm_text_only.pkl`
- `Baselines/ebm_interaction_only.pkl`

IF YOU WANT TO PUSH THESE MODELS TO GITHUB:
1. Install Git LFS (Large File Storage): https://git-lfs.github.com/
2. Run: 
   `git lfs install`
   `git lfs track "*.pkl"`
   `git add .gitattributes`
3. Then you can add and push the models.

OTHERWISE:
These files will simply be excluded from your commit. You can recreate them by running the training scripts provided in this folder.
