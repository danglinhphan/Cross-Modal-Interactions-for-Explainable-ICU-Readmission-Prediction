and came back after chest compressions, atropine and epinephrine. intraoperatively the patient had supracoronary aortic rupture which required large graft placement. she also had aortic valve successfully replaced with 21 mm pericardial valve. pacing wires as well as mediastinal and pleural tubes were placed intraoperatively. the patient was transferred to icu in stable condition. on postoperative day 1 the patient had a few episodes of asystolic which resolved spontaneously and did not require any treatment. patient was afebrile, vital signs were stable. postoperative day 2 the patient was extubated without complications and episodes of atrial fibrillation responded to two amiodarone boluses. she was also started on lasix. she was transferred to the regular floor in stable condition. on postoperative day 3, overnight, patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation. she again responded really well to amiodarone boluses, was started on oral amiodarone. her chest tube was discontinued without complications. foley was discontinued. postoperative day 5 wires were taken out without complication, patient again had an episode of atrial fibrillation responding really well to amiodarone and remained afebrile, vital signs stable, ambulating well with pt. no concerns, no active issues. discharge medications: enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q d, tylenol 325 mg 1-2 tabs po q

patient collapsed, felt nauseated. afterwards, the patients amiodarone was discontinued. the patient was moved to bed rest, had a electrodes placed in her chest rest of the night and the next day were unremarkable. ep was consulted who recommended discontinuing amiodarone which was done, as well as pacemaker placement. that night, the patient had another episode of complete heart block which lasted approximately six seconds. the patient was in bed, did not have nausea or any other symptoms after that or prior to that episode. the patient remained afebrile. rest of vital signs stable. the patient was in normal sinus rhythm. on postoperative day 6, the patient had a dual chamber pacemaker placed by eps service. operation went without complications. it was reported that the patient is now ventricularly paced, but has atrial fibrillation as an underlying ............., so the patient was started on warfarin when she came back to the floor as well as restarted on amiodarone in an attempt

if this becomes uncomfortable for him, he may need another large volume paracentesis, but would proceed with caution given his bleeding tendency. . pancreatitis: on , patient reported epigastric pain and his amylase and lipase were slightly elevated;

brief hospital course: ap: ms. is a 70 year old women with esrd on hd who presents with fever to 103, chills, and tachycardia to 103 with possible line infection. . 1. sepsis: the patient was initially sent to the intensive care unit under the sepsis protocol. she was started on vancomycin for skin flora and unasyn for group d enterococcus (vre) sensitive to amp (previous infections over last year). her blood cultures drawn at grew out oxacillin resistant coag negative staph. her urine cultures were without grown. a cxr was obtained and was without signs of pneumonia. once she was stabilized, ms. was sent to the floor where her tunneled catheter was removed. the tip was sent for culture but did not grow any organisms. access was an issue as 3 attempts in ed failed, including one with us. instead a picc was placed and eventually, after she was free of bacteria for 48 hours, a new tunnel line was placed. despite placement of a new line and clean surveillance cultures, ms. continued to spike fevers. she spiked through her vancomycin which was always re-dosed when her daily levels fell below 15. an ct was obtained, revealing a 7 cm mass, consistent with an abscess, above the bladder. considering that she had been recently hospitalized with a diverticulitis and peritonitis, it seemed urgent to intervene on this abscess. it was evacuated under ir guidance but no organisms appeared on gram stain and nothing grew on culture. it became apparent that this was most likely a fluid collection from the patients peritoneal dialysis. the patient continued to spike fevers so a work up was commenced that included a chest x ray, a tte (since she has a murmur, although old) and more blood and urine cultures. all these studies were negative. as the patient continued to spike fevers and had one bout of emesis, another ct was obtained. it showed diverticulitis and so a 14 day course of flagyl and levofloxacin was started. it was decided that a general surgery consult would be obtained once she was an outpatient in order to faciliate resection of the affected length of bowel. at discharge, ms. was instructed to continue her levo, flagyl, and vanco to complete a 14 day course of each one. her vanco levels were to be followed and redosed at hd. . 2. esrd: ms. usually dialyzes on tues, thurs, sat but here she was switched to monday, wednesday and saturday under the guidance of the renal team. her electrolytes were followed and repleted very consevatively as needed. it was noted that her phosphate calcium product was quite high, so her sevelamer was titrate up. she was also placed on a renal diet. the patient reports making urine, however not an adequate measure of perfusion due to esrd. she hopes to continue her peritoneal dialysis and felt were upset at having to start hd. the method of dialysis was to be further addressed as an outpatient with her pcp . , after her diverticular disease was resolved. . 3. dmii: ms. is usually on oral hypoglycemics. these oral agents were held due to their long half life and instead she was covered with riss with qid finger sticks. her home regimen of glipizide was restarted at discharge. while in house, she was on a controlled carbohydrate diet. . 4. htn: ms. home regimen includes metoprolol, moexipril and diltiazem. initially the metoprolol was continued and the diltiazem and moexipril were held since the patient is currently not hypertensive. before discharge, she was restarted on moexepril but not diltiazem. she was also started on an aspirin and atorvastatin before discharge. . 5. afib: the patient is on coumadin as outpatient for anticoagulation. this was hold anticoagulation in case she required urgent line placement. her rate was easily controlled with beta blocker. before discharge, her coumadin was restarted, but very cautiously as it interacts with her 2 antibiotics for her diverticulitis, flagyl and levofloxacin. she was advised to have her inr followed carefully and her warfarin titrated as needed for an inr . . 6. cad by hx (fixed perfusion defect) but clean coronaries by cath: the patient was continued on metoprolol but given her current

white blood cells, 77% lymphocytes, 2% neutrophils, 21% monocytes. a femoral arterial line was also placed. the micu course is significant for the following: pulmonary: mr. was admitted in fulminant respiratory failure with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and poor compliance. extensive adjustment of the ventilator including multiple recruitment maneuvers, a peep of 20, paralytics and proning was required to achieve pao2s in the 60s on fio2 of 1.0. pressure control ventilation was utilized with volumes of 6cckg per the ardsnet trial. he was ventilated in the prone position from to at which time enough margin was present to place the patient back into the supine position. he continued to gradually improve and was finally extubated on . mr. also two bronchoscopies during the micu stay. the initial bronchoscopy was on , which was unremarkable with no significant sputum or clots. this was repeated approximately 2 to 3 days later after a desaturation which revealed thick brown clots, which were suctioned out successfully and sent for culture. sputum cultures eventually grew out staphylococcus aureus, which was pansensitive. he was treated since admission with vancomycin, as well as other antibiotics, which will be detailed later for staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. cardiovascular: mr. maintained his blood pressure until the morning of . at that time, blood pressure began to decrease and he was placed on levophed and vasopressin for blood pressure maintenance. he was gradually weaned off these pressors. mr. was also tachycardiac throughout his stay, secondary to fever, septic cardiomyopathy. echocardiogram was done on , which showed ef of 15% with bilateral ventricular dysfunction. there were no focal-wall abnormalities - therefore this was reflective of sepsis related myocardial suppression. the echocardiogram was repeated on , which showed mild right ventricular depression and dilatation, but left ventricular function was within normal limits. mr. right heart catheterization on . initial pulmonary artery pressure was 3425 with the mean of 29, wedge of 22, cvp of 20, heart output of 4.69, cardiac index of 2.88, svr of 921, pvr of 119. over the next few days the svr decreased to 600 with increasing cardiac output likely secondary to sepsis. he was placed on dobutamine to increase cardiac output with success. the dobutamine was finally discontinued approximately two days after initiation. fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition: mr. was npo for several days. he placed for about five days on tpn and then switched to tube feeds on . tube feeds had been tried before unsuccessfully secondary to poor gastric motility. high residuals were noted. infectious disease: mr. was initially suspected to have meningococcemia secondary to diffuse skin lesions and fulminant presentation. however, lp showed no organisms and only eight wbcs. similarly, his blood cultures were negative. he received one dose of ceftriaxone at the outside hospital. he was noted to have new maculopapular rash over his upper extremities and torso. ceftriaxone was discontinued on admission to secondary to possible allergy. however, this was restarted one day later per infectious disease recommendation and continued for two days. mr. showed increasing angioedema over the face with ct of the neck showing significant laryngeal edema as well. there was eosinophilia within the blood and ceftriaxone was discontinued at this time. it should be noted that mr. has a ceftrione allergy, possible anaphylaxis. he was also started on clindamycin, levaquin, doxycycline, and vancomycin for unknown infectious etiology. the vancomycin and clindamycin were for gram positive and doxycycline for possibility rickettsial disease even though it was not the usual season. mr. also received igg times two for possible toxic-shock syndrome. aso was positive and all viral cultures, including influenza, rsv, parainfluenza were negative. all cultures returned negative, including urine, blood, stool, csfs. the only positive cultures were staphylococcus aureus and minimal yeast in the sputum. with the advent of the pansensitive staphylococcus aureus clindamycin and doxycycline were discontinued six to seven days after starting. levaquin was discontinued on . vancomycin will be likely continued for ten days past the positive culture for staphylococcus aureus. it is currently dosed for hemodialysis. it should also be noted that mr. received xigris or apc activated protein c for approximately 30 hours. this was discontinued initially secondary to low platelets and high ptc and then again secondary to new anisocoria. head ct was repeated on , which showed no bleeding. renal: mr. was admitted with high bun, high creatinine of unknown etiology. at the outside hospital sediment was noted to have red blood cell casts and hyaline casts. this was repeated on admission to and only hyaline casts were noted, signifying possible atn. his renal function initially improved significantly with hydration and support. however, his ck which was mildly elevated on admission progressed to florid rhabdomyolysis with cks peaking at over 250,000. this was felt secondary to massive sepsis response but perhaps related to paralytics. the surgery team was consulted to rule out compartment syndrome which was determined not to be present. this unfortunately, caused a secondary significant renal insult. despite alkalinizing the urine mr. renal function again delined prior to ultimately recovering again. within the first 24hours, he became increasingly acidotic with ph of 7.06 and decreasing urine output. the renal service was consulted and recommended and started cvvh via a left femoral catheter. about ten days later, a right sided cvh catheter was introduced but unfortunately clotted off approximately 24 to 48 hours later. the cvh was finally discontinued on . on , mr. hemodialysis and this will be continued on a three-times-weekly basis. acidosis has completely resolved. skin: mr. was noted to have ecchymotic regions over the anterior thighs, feet and ankles bilaterally shortly after admission. these lesions appeared to be an extension of the initial maculopapular rash noted on admission. in the intervening days, they were noted to become increasingly necrotic in appearance. dermatology and plastic surgery services were consulted for guidance of management. eventually, some of the skin sloughed off. plastic surgery continued to follow -- mr. may require skin grafting at a later time. the fifth digit on both feet were affected. the plastic surgery team felt they may require amputation eventually. in the meantime, he has been treated with silvadene, xeroform, and kerlix per plastic surgery recommendations with daily improvement. hematology: mr. was noted to have low platelets and elevated creatinine suggesting possible hus versus ttp. the department of hematology was following the patient and noted that the smear had only a few schistocytes, but no obvious signs for ttp or hus. instead, the remainder of the diagnosis was dic and the coagulations were carefully monitored over the next few days. he received several platelet transfusions in the interim to keep his platelets above 30, especially while the patient was on apc. the thrombocytopenia eventually resolved and his platelets have returned to 369,000. mr. hematocrit had been intermittently down to 21.5 from the upper limits of 34 to 40. he was given two units of packed red blood cells. since then, mr. has maintained his hematocrit successfully. he was on epogen for three days for indication of decreased need for transfusions during his critical illness. endocrine: mr. blood sugars were noted to be excessively high secondary to sepsis and he was started on insulin drip for three days. prophylaxis: mr. was initially on iv protonix and heparin via the cvvh. pneumoboots were not used secondary to the skin lesions on his legs. subcutaneous heparin was utilized once his coagulation issues were resolved. lines: mr. had right ij placed, which was changed over a wire. he currently has right ij in place, day 8. right femoral hemodialysis on day 4. he recently had left radial line, which has been discontinued. disposition: mr. family is very supportive and has been in contact daily. is full code. he was being transferred at this time from the micu to the floor for further management. , p. m.d. dictated by: medquist36 d: 11:46 t: 12:05 job: name: , unit no: admission date: discharge date: date of birth: sex: m service: medical medical

blood cell and good oxygenation on room air. he was to continue to receive vancomycin 1 gram iv based on vancomycin levels. the patient was dosed for vancomycin level of less than or equal to 15. he was to continue his course of vancomycin through , which is 14 days after his bronchoscopy and last negative culture. 2. renal: the patient demonstrated improving urine output and diminishing creatinine. on the day prior to discharge, the creatinine had fallen to 4.0. hemodialysis was discontinued on friday, , and the dialysis catheter was removed secondary to some bleeding around the catheter site. it was anticipated by the renal team that the patient would have recovery of his baseline renal function within in approximately 40 days of discharge. he was continued on amphojel until phosphorus level was less than 5, as well as tums. 3. hematology: the patients hematocrit remained stable during this portion of his hospital stay. he was started on niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. per

date: discharge date: service: history of present illness: mr. is a 77-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypass graft times two, aortic valve replacement, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia, who was transferred to the for an electrophysiology study and a possible ablation of ventricular tachycardia from an outside hospital after recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia setting off his icd four times in the past three days. the patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since the and has had episodes of ventricular tachycardia for the past few years. he was recently admitted to in with fatigue and bradycardia with a heart rate in the 40s and av block. during that admission, he went into monomorphic ventricular tachycardia treated with intravenous lidocaine. he then went back into ventricular tachycardia and had a five second pause and a dual chamber icd pacemaker was placed. at that time, he was able to end his episodes of ventricular tachycardia with overdrug pacing. he was sent home on sotalol and mexiletine. at a clinic visit two weeks later, his icd was interrogated and he was found to have had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia. he was sent to the electrophysiology laboratory for ventricular tachycardia ablation. they found two foci and ablated one. the second one was not ablated because it was to close to his replacement valve. the ablation procedure was . after discharge, he was fine until saturday when he felt his heart beating rapidly and he felt lightheaded. he presented to the emergency department but was sent home because there were no beds. he felt his icd shock him twice on , , and twice again yesterday . he presented to hospital at 5 p.m. with a rapid heart rate and chest tightness and was found to be in ventricular tachycardia. his ventricular tachycardia was occasionally able to be stopped by overdrug pacing, but was not consistently stopped. he was started on a lidocaine drip and transferred to for further electrophysiological evaluation. on admission, he denied chest pain, chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, headache, fever, chills, nausea and vomiting. he also denied hematemesis, hematochezia but says he has dark stools because he takes iron at home. he denied urinary difficulties, indigestion, weight loss. has a history of claudication in his legs but denies rest pain. he also denies orthopnea. past medical history: 1. hypertension. 2. hypercholesterolemia. 3. former smoker. 4. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

400 mg q.d. allergies: morphine causes mental status change, procan causes ventricular tachycardia and shellfish. social history: mr. is retired. he is married. he lives in . he worked for the fire department. he quit smoking tobacco 30 years ago. he also quit using alcohol years ago. he is visiting his son in , . family history: his brother died of an myocardial infarction at age 55. physical exam on admission: pulse 68. respiratory rate 17. afebrile. blood pressure 10640. 02 saturation 97% on two liters. generally, he was awake and alert, the newspaper. head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: pupils equal, round and reactive to light. extraocular movements full. oropharynx clear. moist mucous membranes. neck: he has a scar on the right neck from cea, no jugular venous distention, supple. lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. heart was regular rate and rhythm, s1, s2 with a loud mechanical valve murmur. abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.

pacing at 70 beats per minute. assessment and plan: the patient is a 77-year-old with a history of coronary artery bypass graft times two, avr, atrial fibrillation and recurrent ventricular tachycardia status post icd pacer placement admitted now after a recent ventricular tachycardia ablation last week for further electrophysiology evaluation. 1. cardiovascular: rhythm. patient has recurrent ventricular tachycardia. we discontinued lidocaine and started mexiletine at 130 mg t.i.d. electrophysiology evaluated his icd and changed various settings which will hopefully make the patient less likely to be shocked and hopefully will be able to terminate his episodes of recurrent ventricular tachycardia without being defibrillated. throughout admission, the patient had intermittent episodes of ventricular tachycardia which were terminated without being defibrillated. the patient was started on mexiletine 150 mg t.i.d. his amiodarone was continued at 400 mg q.d. and it was decided that recurrent ventricular tachycardia ablation would be not undertaken at this time. 2. pump: the patient had an echocardiogram during the course of admission which showed the left atrium mildly dilated, left atrium also elongated, the right atrium moderately dilated. there was moderate symmetric left ventricular function. the left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated, overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depression. resting regional wall motion abnormalities include akinesis of the inferior septum and inferior walls at the base and mid ventricular levels. lateral wall and apex demonstrated moderate hypokinesis. there is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. a bibasilar aortic valve prosthesis is present. trace aortic regurgitation is seen. moderate to severe 3 mitral regurgitation. the patient was continued on enalapril and lopressor for his cardiomyopathy. 3. valve disease: the patient is status post aortic valve replacement. his coumadin was held during his admission for possible electrophysiology study. he was started on a heparin drip. the patient was then restarted on his coumadin at 3 mg q.p.m. with an inr goal of 2.5 to 3.5 and discharged on lovenox. his pt and inr will be checked as an outpatient two days after discharge. 4. coronary artery disease: the patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft times two. he is on zocor and aspirin. he is also on imdur for angina. none of these medications were changed. 5. pulmonary: the patient was saturating well on two liters of nasal cannula, then saturating well on room air. the patient has no home 02. because the patient was started on amiodarone some time in the last month without any prior pulmonary function tests, the patient was sent for pulmonary function tests during this admission. 6. renal: the patient is status post a right renal percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. his baseline creatinine is 1.6 to 2.3. creatinine remained stable around 1.5 throughout the hospital course. 7. gastrointestinal: the patient had no issues. he was started on zantac. 8. infectious disease: the patient remained afebrile throughout his hospital course with a stable white count. 9. hematology: the patient has a history of chronic anemia. he is on iron at home. his anemia is most likely due to iron deficiency, possibly some slight hemolysis due his aortic valve replacement, as well as possibly renal disease. 10. fluid, electrolytes and nutrition: the patient remained euvolemic. his electrolytes were followed and repleted as needed. patient ate well during the hospital course. discharge condition: stable. discharge status: to home. discharge medications 1. zocor 40 mg q.d. 2. imdur 90 mg q.d. 3. enalapril 5 mg b.i.d. 4. aspirin

continued on his normal dose of dilantin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. for seizure prophylaxis secondary to an avm repair in . the patient and the pcp report five such episodes of left-sided weakness, tingling, and dysarthria have occurred since pacemaker implantation, although current episode of syncope was void of such symptoms. denied fevers, chills, anesthesia, illness, lightheadedness, visual changes, postictal state, chest pain, nausea, vomiting. past medical history: 1. as above, a pacemaker, single-chamber, inserted in for vasovagal syncope which was explanted in secondary to cellulitis. 2. avm resection in . the patient was on dilantin and phenobarbital from to for seizure prophylaxis, was taken off aeds in , recently restarted on dilantin three weeks ago. 3. gout, last flare in with right metatarsal head inflamed, currently stable. 4. hypertension. 5. hypercholesterolemia. admission medications: dilantin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. allergies: codeine. family history: no history of stroke or seizure. positive for chronic atrial fibrillation in a younger brother. maternal grandmother has type 2 diabetes, no cad, colon cancer, skin cancer. social history: the patient is a self-employed contractor. denied smoking, drugs. occasional alcohol use. no substance abuse. physical examination on admission: vital signs: the patient was afebrile at 97, heart rate 59, blood pressure 17385. orthostatics checked on the floor were negative, breathing at a rate of 16, 98% on room air. heent: ncat, mmm, perrla, eomi, fields full, no nystagmus. neck: supple. no adenopathy. no carotid bruits appreciated. cardiac: regular rate, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally. abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds. extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema. capillary refill less than two seconds. neurologic: mental status-alert and oriented times three. speech appropriate, fluent, naming and repetition intact, comprehension intact. cranial nerves ii through xii without deficits. tongue midline. palate elevation normal. face symmetric. motor: no tremor. normal bulk, tone. no pronator drift, midline. strength was symmetric and full on both sides. sensory: intact to light touch, pinprick, temperature, vibration, and proprioception. reflexes were 3 in the right upper extremity, 3 in the left upper extremity, 3 right lower and left lower extremities. the toes were downgoing bilaterally. coordination: finger-to-nose no ataxia, rapid finger tapping intact bilaterally. gait: romberg negative, narrow base stance. no difficulty with tandem gait. laboratoryradiologic data: pertinent for a creatinine of 1.1 which is his baseline, glucose 103, calcium 8.7, phosphorus 3, magnesium 2. ck troponin negative. tsh 2.7. homocysteine 14. triglycerides 326, hdl 42, ldl 190. white count 6.3, hematocrit 42, platelets 179,000. prothrombin time 11, partial thromboplastin time 25. the patient had a cta and could not undergo mri due to right craniotomy clips as well as retained ventricular pacing wire. no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. scattered calcifications in the left internal carotid and left vertebral body with mild midbasilar narrowing, no aneurysm identified. ekg showed sinus bradycardia, borderline left axis deviation, rsr pattern in v1 with normal qrs duration. the patients workup for both presentations of syncope and observed in the emergency room with stable vital signs. the stroke team, cardiology, electrophysiology, and neurosurgery were consulted for appropriate workup. the patient remained on telemetry and the vital signs were stable throughout. an eeg had been performed prior as an outpatient which was negative for seizure which was low on the differential. tee and tte with bulbar study were negative for asd or pfo. it was felt that this was less likely to represent embolic phenomenon. carotid ultrasounds were negative. it was felt that angiography would be the best to apprise posterior circulation. angiography was performed by dr. which revealed a stenosis of the left vertebral artery at its origin as well as a midbasilar stenosis of approximately 70-80%. at that time, the decision for intervention was made on the left vertebral artery on the basis of providing the most flow to the already stenotic basilar lesion. hospital course: the patient was started on aspirin, plavix, as well as risk factor modification with b12, b6, and folate administered due to elevated homocysteine. lipitor was started given prior elevated lipid panel. the patient underwent uncomplicated stenting of the origin of the left vertebral artery with good distal flow, no focal neurologic deficit. the patient remained free of syncopal and dysarthria, left-sided weakness, or neurologic sequelae throughout. in discussion with cardiology and neurology, at this time, episodes likely represent dual episodes of vasovagal syncope and tia. transient ischemic attacks are being addressed with antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and plavix as well as decreasing lipid profile and addressing homocysteine elevation. if the patient experiences further vasovagal episodes, this would warrant implantation of the pacer. it was felt that pacemaker placement right now was not sufficient enough to fully address his known basilar stenosis. at this time, the risks and benefits were in favor of holding pacemaker placement and continue with a trial of medical management and observation post left vertebral stenting. discharge medications: 1. dilantin 100 b.i.d. this is to be tapered per pcp until off as no history nor likelihood of seizure disorder. 2. aspirin 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. 3. plavix 75 mg p.o. b.i.d. 4. folic acid one tablet p.o. q.d. 5. vitamin b12 and b6 p.o. q.d. 6. lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d. pending further lft checks. statin dose should be maximized given the patients severe atherosclerotic risk. follow-up: the patient is to follow-up in one to two weeks with dr. , his pcp, appraise neurologic examination, monitor for signs of further syncopal episodes andor tia episodes. possible initiation of low-dose ace inhibitor if blood pressure and heart rate stable. disposition: the patient was discharged to home in stable condition without neurologic deficits on antiplatelet therapy post stenting of the left vertebral artery. dictated by: medquist36 d: 03:39 t:

since the prior study of - mri read pending - hip ultrasound: mostly solid 4 cm hematoma extending anteriorly from the femoral prosthesis to the proximal femoral diaphysis with no definite signs of abscess . mri pelvis: bilateral masses with a large intrapelvic component, larger on the right, which appear related to the joints. evaluation is suboptimal. these masses were present on the prior ct examination, but appear somewhat smaller in size. hematoma is not considered likely due to the chronicity. however, given the history of multiple hip replacements, the bilaterallity, and the unusual appearance of these lesions, foremost consideration is given to a foreign-body reaction. less likely would be a proliferative synovial condition such as pvns, or synovial chondromatosis. . us

red fluid was sent for gram stain and culture. brief hospital course: 88 yo f with past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, and sp bilateral hip replacements who presented with lethargy and found to have left hip hematoma now transfered to the micu for possible sepsis from gpcs. . ) sepsis: she presented with hypotension in the setting of fevers and elevated wbc count and group-b streptococcal bacteremia cw septic physiology. she was admitted to the micu and was originally started on vancomycinpip-tazo on however antibiotics were changed to penicillin g when hip fluid and blood cultures grew out group b strep sensitive to penicillin. she defervesced and bps stabilized and she was transferred out of the unit to the general medicine service. tte was negative for vegetations. orthopedics was consulted who offered possible surgical intervention for removal of her hardware from previous total hip replacement, however patient and her family and hcp opted against surgical intervention. thus, she will need continued iv antibiotics (3 million units iv pen g q6h) for 6-8 weeks and then will likely need oral antibiotics following iv course. she is scheduled for follow in the infectious disease clinic. . ) left hip hematoma with secondary infection with group b strep and source of gbs bacteremia. her pain was managed with lidoderm patch, standing tylenol and prn morphine iv. she was noted to have had on admission a significant hematocrit drop from her baseline, but her hct remained stable not requiring prbc transfusion. she did, however, receive 3u ffp on admission to the icu as her inr was supratherapeutic at that time. her coumadin was held, but her inr did not adequately come down so she required po vitamin k in order to decrease her inr. as her hct remained stable without any signs of expanding hemotoma, orthopedics was okay with the reinitiation of coumadin for her a. fib, so it was restarted at her home dose. . ) congestive heart failure: on admission, she had elevated bnp and right-sided pleural effusion. however, she appeared intravascularly dry by labs and initial exam. she was found to be in acute renal failure on presentation thought to prerenal etiology so her diuretics were held. echocardiogram revealed moderate lvh with preserved lv systolic function, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. upon transfer to the floor, however, she had persistent supplemental oxygen requirement and crackles on pulmonary exam. as her renal function had improved, diuresis was reinitiated and at time of discharge, she was maintaining o2 saturation on room air. she will be discharged on home dose lasix and lisinopril. . ) acute renal failure: creatinine was elevated to 1.9 intitially, with baseline 0.9-1.1. this was thought most likely secondary to pre-renal etiology possibly secondary to septic physiology and atn in the setting of hypotension on presentation. her acei and lasix were held and her renal function normalized. her lasix was restarted and her renal function remained stable. her acei was then restarted with renal function remaining stable at her baseline. . ) atrial fibrillation: on chronic anticoagulation as an outpatient, however inr was 4 upon admission. her coumadin was held, but her inr did not adequately come down likely secondary to dietary vitamin k deficiency so she received additional po vitamin k with good response of her inr. she does have significant risk of thromboembolic event based on her chads score, so hct remained stable without evidence of expanding hematoma when cleared by orthopedics for reinitiation, she was restarted on her home dose of coumadin. inr at time of discharge was 1.9. additionally, she was continued on diltiazem for rate control. . ) elevated blood sugar: although she has no clear documented history of diabetes mellitus and was not on any oral medications upon admission, her blood sugar remained elevated during her entire stay. she was placed on insulin sliding scale while inpatient with goal for tight control in the setting of her infection. this will need to be continued upon discharge and further management evaluated by her primary care physician upon follow up. . ) hypertension: although she orinally presented hypotensive, treatment of her infection improved her blood pressure. her lasix and acei were originally held, but were restarted with improvement in her renal function and increase in her blood pressure. . ) dementia: she was continued on

saphenous vein graft to pda. in the operating room, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed perioperatively due to the patients low ejection fraction. please see operative note for further details. the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit on milrinone and levophed infusion. the patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on postoperative day zero, continuing on levophed and milrinone with adequate cardiac output. on postoperative day number one, the milrinone was weaned, however, the patients cardiac output decreased and it was felt that he was not tolerating the weaning of the medication. the patient was returned to previous dose and on postoperative day number two, the milrinone was again weaned and successfully discontinued by evening of postoperative day number two the patient maintained adequate cardiac output and index. the levophed was weaned to off. on postoperative day number three, the patient was started on lasix. the pulmonary artery catheter was removed. chest tubes were removed without incident. on the evening of postoperative day number three, the patient had a 42 beat run of ventricular tachycardia. at the time the patient was asymptomatic with a stable blood pressure. the patient was given two grams of magnesium and an electrophysiology service consultation was obtained. recommendations were made to start the patient on low dose beta blocker and plans were made for an electrophysiology service study due to the patients low ejection fraction and ventricular ectopy. the patient had an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 30%, dilated right and left atrium, moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, one to two plus mitral regurgitation and one to two plus tricuspid regurgitation. the patient remained in the intensive care unit and continued without any further ventricular tachycardia. the patient tolerated his low dose beta blocker, however, the patient occasionally had episodes of bradycardia with rates in the 30s to 40s while asleep. the patient was asymptomatic from this. this seemed to improve over the course of the next few days. on postoperative day number six, the patients pacing wires were removed without incident. the patient was taken to the electrophysiology laboratory for electrophysiology studies which were negative for any inducible ventricular tachycardia. it was felt at this time that the patient was not a candidate for an aicd. the patients hematocrit was noted to be 25; he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells. on postoperative day number seven, the patient was transferred from the intensive care unit to the regular part of the hospital. he began working with physical therapy. in the evening of postoperative day number seven, while the patient was asleep, the patient was noted to have a period of bradycardia with an approximately 4.5 second pause. electrophysiology service was again re-consulted and it was felt that the patient was asymptomatic and that the episodes were only happening while the patient was asleep and there was no further intervention required. the patient continued on a heparin infusion for anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation. coumadin was restarted. by postoperative day number nine, the patient was cleared from physical therapy and was able to ambulate 500 feet and climb one flight of stairs without difficulty. by postoperative day number ten, the patients inr still remained low in spite of three doses of coumadin. discussions with dr. were had and it was decided to discharge the patient to home on subcutaneous injections of lovenox with continued coumadin therapy until the patients inr was therapeutic. of note, the patient had a tsh checked during his arrhythmia work-up. tsh was noted to be elevated at 7.4 and it was felt that no therapy was needed but it would be recommended that the patient have his tsh rechecked again in one month. condition at discharge: temperature maximum 98.6 f.;

pneumonia. persistent tachycardia and hypoxia. assess for pe. comparison: chest x-ray of . technique: ct angiogram of the chest before and after the administration of optiray nonionic contrast due to fast bolus technique. multiplanar reformatted images were obtained. ct angiogram of the chest: there is no sign of filling defect within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism. there is a high-grade stenosis within the left subclavian artery. there is diffuse severe emphysema bilaterally. focal areas of consolidation are noted on the right, some of which are slightly mass like. attention to these areas on followup is recommended after treatment. there is no pleural or pericardial effusion. there is a small pericardial effusion. there is no axillary lymphadenopathy. a small upper mediastinal node measuring 7 mm in greatest short axis dimension is noted. there are dense calcifications within the aortic arch and within the coronary arteries. small left hilar lymph nodes are also seen. limited images of the upper abdomen demonstrate dense calcifications within the aorta and branches. no other gross abnormality is appreciated. bone windows: there are degenerative changes within the spine including a thoracic kyphosis. impression: 1) no evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2) diffuse emphysema. right-sided consolidation consistent with pneumonia. follow up chest ct in 6 weeks after treatment is recommended to ensure that these changes resolve. attention should be paid to several more nodular opacities on the right. 3) 8-mm anterior superior mediastinal node as well as small lymph nodes in the left hilum. attention to these regions on followup is recommended. 4) high-grade stenosis of the left proximal subclavian artery. clinically correlate. brief hospital course: mr. is a 76 year-old male with a history of severe copd requiring intubation, trach and multiple hospitalizations in the past. on the day of admission, he called 911 and was brought in to the ed by ems for increased dyspnea. he became febrile earlier that day with chills. he denied gigu symptoms, cough and chest pain. he was given albuterol and atrovent nebs in the ambulance without improvment. in the ed he was found febrile to 103.1 and tachycardiac. his rr was in the 40s, with o2 sats in the low 80s. he was intubated for acute respiratory distress. his wbc count was 11.2, with 80% neutrophils and 6 bands. a cxr revealed a lll opacity. he received levofloxacin and iv steroids for copd exacerbation. enzymes revealed a troponin leak, though ecg in the ed showed only tachycardia and rbbb. he was then admitted to the micu. vancomycin was added for mrsa coverage, given history of hospitalizations at va with mrsa. he was weaned and extubated on and transferred to the floor . once extubated, levofloxacin and vancomycin were continued. he was on scheduled albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments every 4-6 hours and he continued to use his home advair inhaler. he was switched from iv steroids to 60mg of prednisone. on he continued to have tachycardia. subsequent ecgs revealed inferior-lateral st changes. two sets of enzymes were negative, and his ecg changes were attributed to demand phenomenon in the setting of hypoxia and tachycardia. the patient had no chest pain, other clinical symptoms or signs of ischemia. repeat chest xray revealed lll opacity, pleural effusions and signs of pulmonary edema and left heart failure. he was diuresed with 10 mg of furosemide to improve his pulmonary status. patient denied orthopnea, did not have lower extremity edema, and follow-up chest x-rays continued to show improvement, as the patient auto-diuresed. issues upon transfer to the floor: 1.)lll pna: this continued to show radiographic and symptomatic improvement on levofloxacin (10 day course) . his wbc trended down, and he remained afebrile. vancomycin was stopped after four days as it use was not supported by cultures. this was felt to be the main exacerbant of his copd flair. 2.) sobcopd: this was treated by addressing both the likely exacerbant, his pneumonia, as well as the underlying pulmonary disease. this latter approach included scheduled albuterol and ipratropium nebs (hope to eventually transitioned to mdis), a twice daily fluticasonesalmeterol inhaler, and a prednisone taper. mr. unfortunately responded relatively slowly to this treatment, following a gradual waxing and course of both symptoms and oxygen saturations. given his slow improvement and low oxygen sats there was some concern for a pe and a cta was obtained.in addition, patient received fluids in the micu, and chest x-ray at that time was consistent with heart failure, however patient diuresed well on his own with improvement. however, since then he remained quite sob and was low 90s on five liters nc, a cta was done- no evidence of pe. please see the results section. patient now being transfered to hospital and we recommend a pulmonary consult (patient transfered prior to consult being obtained- if pulmonary is able to see the patient prior to dc - we will attach their recommendation). patient will likely need a repeat ct in weeks to look for resolution of changes associated with pneumonia. his prednisone was increased back to 40 mg qd given his persistent hypoxemia and will need a slow taper. 3.)elevated cardiac enzymes: mr. has no known history of cad, with no prior anginal symptoms. he had minimally elevated troponin-t (0.02) with a ck of 279 and 221 on two separate values when first admitted that subsequently trended down to 0.01 (with normal cks), where they remained. this was felt to be secondary to his copd flair; the resultant hypoxia and tachycardia may have induced a moderate degree of demand ischemia. he also had inverted t-waves and st-depression laterally that similarly improved with his symptoms. 4.)anemia -- his hematocrit remained low but stable throughout the admission. iron studies were checked that demonstrated an anemia of chronic disease. b12 and folate were both normal. his hct remained stable. 5.)anxiety -- mr. appears to have some baseline anxiety that was certainly made worse by his marked dyspnea. to help alleviate this in the acute period, he was started on clonazepam 0.25mg twice daily with good effect. 6) c. diff- upon transfer to floor, patient had some diarrhea and tested positive for c. diff, this was treated with flagyl for a 14 day course. medications on admission: ipratropiumalbuterol (combivent) mdi 18mcg90mcg 2 puffs four times daily fluticasonesalmeterol

several weeks, and was found to have three mass lesions in her brain on head ct. the patient was started on decadron, as well as dilantin. in the emergency room she became hypertensive and was sent to the sicu. she was maintained on nipride gtt. in the intensive care unit, the patient was weaned off nipride and then changed to labetalol, hydralazine. the patient was also noted to have cellulitis on her left knee and was initially maintained on vancomycin and later changed to keflex. the patient was also evaluated by radiationoncology, and it was decided that the patient would received a total of seven treatments of whole brain radiation therapy in conjunction with decadron, as well as dilantin. during her intensive care unit stay, the patient had increased alertness and was more oriented, although she does have a history of baseline dementia. past medical history: metastatic melanoma status post resection in with recurrence in status post treatment with taxol. history of paroxysmal

walks but recently was unable to do so. she otherwise has a very close family. family history: on maternal side there is a history of diabetes, as well as hypertension. physical examination: vital signs: temperature 96.5, blood pressure 16147, pulse 74, respirations 14, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 l, 92% on room air. general: she was elderly, lying in bed. she was sometimes agitated and not following commands. she was nonverbal. heent: normocephalic, atraumatic. pupils equal, round and reactive to light. extraocular movements intact. dry mucous membranes. there was poor dentition. neck: supple. no lymphadenopathy. heart: regular, rate and rhythm. there was an early systolic ejection murmur, 3 out of 6. lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally. abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended. good bowel sounds. extremities: there were bilateral skin eschars. the left knee had excoriation and was erythematous. neurological: the patient was obtunded and not following commands. she had a limited neurologic exam. cranial nerves ii, iii and iv intact. she was moving both hands with appropriate strength. no lifting of left arm off bed. right lower extremity with decreased strength, apparently chronic secondary to polio. on the left lower extremity, she moved toes and feet. laboratory data: on admission her white count was 6.4, hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 269, neutrophils 73, 22 lymphs, 3 monos; inr 1.1, pt 12.7, ptt 27.8; sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 106, bicarb 22, bun 36, creatinine 1.8, baseline 1.4-1.5; platelet count 151; calcium 10.6, magnesium 1.9, phos 3.1,

which new consistent with . head ct showed three moderately large-sized mass lesions in the right posterior frontal, right anterior frontal lobe and left parietal lesion with significant edema. there was a small amount of peripheral density, question of hemorrhage or calcification. chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, atelectasis, but no overt failure. knee films showed no fracture and no dislocation and degenerative changes with small right knee effusion. hospital course: 1. altered mental status: this was felt to be secondary to metastatic disease to the brain. the patient was evaluated by radiationoncology, and it was decided that the patient would receive a total of seven treatments of whole-brain radiation therapy. additionally she was maintained on decadron, as well as dilantin. the patient had no seizure activity while in the hospital. she tolerated her decadron well and tolerated her whole-brain radiation therapy without any complications. the patient was discharged on a decadron taper. her dilantin dose was increased to a total of 300 three times a day, given that her dilantin level .i.d. was only 8. the patient will need her dilantin level followed as an outpatient at her next appointment. 2. hypertension: the patients blood pressures while in the emergency room were noted to be 200100; however, once she was transferred to the floor, she maintained very good control on a combination of clonidine, hydrochlorothiazide and minoxidil, hydralazine, as well as labetalol 400 b.i.d. the patients blood pressures were maintained in the 140s to 160s systolic, and it was decided that this was an appropriate range given that the patient needed to have adequate perfusion in the face of increased intracranial pressure. 3. cellulitis: the patient was initially maintained on vancomycin, and this was later changed to keflex. the patient did not develop any rash or other complications keflex. her cellulitis was improved by the time of discharge. 4. renal insufficiency: her creatinine remained at baseline between 1.4-1.5. 5. coronary artery disease: the patient was maintained on enteric coated aspirin, as well as labetalol. the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction, and her electrocardiogram remained stable without any ekg changes. 6. fen: the patient was maintained on a soft diet, as well as thin liquids. she tolerated this without event. additionally her electrolytes were followed daily and were repleted as needed. her ios were monitored closely. 7. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: the patient is paced. she was rate controlled. she was held off all anticoagulation given her metastatic disease to the brain. disposition: the patient was discharged to her home because her family wanted the patient to do so. the patient has full-time nurses that will be following her once she is discharged to home. her mental status improved greatly while the patient was in the hospital. by the time of discharge, the patient was conversive and much more alert and oriented. her neurologic exam was significant for intact cranial nerves and the ability to move all extremities spontaneously. she did have limited movement in her arms, given that she has a history of bursitis. otherwise, the patients exam neurologically was much improved. condition on discharge: stable. she was stable on room air. she could not ambulate without assistance and does need help with all bed transfers. she was tolerating a p.o. diet without problems. mental status had improved considerably in that she was conversant, could move her extremities spontaneously, and cranial nerves were intact. her strength was notable for weakness throughout but was symmetric. discharge diagnosis: 1. metastatic melanoma with metastases to the liver, lung and brain. 2. hypertension. 3. hypercholesterolemia. 5. osteoarthritis. 6. bursitis. 7. cellulitis. 8. chronic renal insufficiency. 9. coronary artery disease. 10. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. discharge status: as stated above, the patient will be discharged to home with nursing care. home hospice has been discussed with the family, and they would like to avail this possibility as the need arises. discharge medications: fluconazole nitrate powder to be applied b.i.d. as needed, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg 1 p.o. q.d., minoxidil 10 mg 1 tab p.o. q.d., hydralazine 25 mg 3 tab p.o. q.6

date: discharge date: service: med this is a discharge summary addendum from previous discharge summary. regarding the patients possible adrenal insufficiency, after discussion with the endocrinology consult and with patients a.m. cortisol level of 12 on the morning of prior to a dose of 20 mg of prednisone, it is most likely that patient is not adrenally insufficient given that she has a normal cortisol level. it was recommended by the endocrinology team that patient continue on a prednisone taper of 20 mg q day for the next day, , and then taper to 10 mg q day afterwards starting on until patient can have a follow up appointment with the endocrinologist. at the time of this dictation an endocrine appointment is still being scheduled depending on whether the patient would like to stay close to home or whether she can return to for follow up. patient will no longer need fludrocortisone so this was discontinued. she will need -stem test on her endocrine follow up appointment while she is a dose of prednisone 10 mg a day. in addition, it is important that note that patient will require stress dose steroids in the event of an infection or other stress given that she has been on high dose steroids which may have suppressed some adrenal function. so place make the correct that patients prednisone taper will not be as dictated in the pervious discharge summary but will be spelled out on the . all other discharge medications are the same as previous discharge summary. , dictated by: medquist36 d: 12:19:57 t: 12:33:56 job: admission date: discharge date: service: med history of present illness: the patient is an 83-year-old female with history of myelodysplastic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia with recent diagnosis of bilateral adrenal masses found during a workup for acute renal failure in an outside hospital, who was transferred from an outside hospital ( ) after developing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. apparently, patient presented on at with acute renal failure, hyperkalemic with k of 7.3 and hyponatremic with a sodium of 130. during workup of patients acute renal failure at , patient had an abdominal ct, which showed bilateral adrenal masses measuring up to 7.5 cm in ap diameter on the left and 6 cm in ap diameter on the right. patient was then discharged and represented for an adrenal mass biopsy on , and was sent back to transitional care unit. on , then patient then developed tachycardia and fever at . chest x- ray was consistent with chf. patient was given nitro paste and lasix, and then became hypotensive to the 60s. dobutamine was started at outside hospital and patient received levofloxacin for a question of uti as well as vancomycin. she was also given a dose of solu-medrol for a question of adrenal insufficiency. prior to solu-medrol administration, serum cortisol was checked at outside hospital and was low at 13. patient also had an aldosterone checked at that time, which was low at 3.0, normal range is 4 to 31. patient was started on dobutamine and dopamine at the outside hospital. dobutamine was then discontinued and neo- synephrine was started. patient had only received a 250 cc normal saline bolus prior to the start of pressors. abdominal ct scan was performed, which showed no bleed. the patient was then at this point transferred to the medical intensive care unit for further management. on arrival to the micu, patient was on dopamine and neo- synephrine, and her blood pressure was 8139, heart rate 120s, and was saturating 100 percent on nonrebreather. over the course of her micu stay for one night, patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated with 2-3 liters of normal saline and her pressors were weaned to off. she was continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin, levofloxacin for a question of urinary tract infection and sepsis. she also received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26. she was continued on empiric stress-dosed steroids of 100 mg of iv hydrocortisone q.8. for question of adrenal insufficiency. stim test was not checked since the patient had received solu-medrol at an outside hospital. since patients blood pressure was stable and she had no acute icu issues, patient was transferred to medicine floor on for further management. past medical history: 1. hypercholesterolemia. 2. myelodysplastic syndrome being managed by patients outpatient oncologist, dr. . 3. bilateral adrenal masses recently diagnosed on at hospital. biopsy results from the adrenal glands revealed a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm with vague epithelioid features, although no pigment is identified, the prominent nucleoli suggested the possibility of malignant melanoma, however, a germ cell neoplasm or large cell lymphoma could not be excluded. additional immunohistochemistry stains were sent and are still pending at the time of this dictation, and will not be available for at least a week. medications on admission: 1. lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d. 2. neupogen 300 mg subq q.d. 3. vancomycin and levofloxacin started at outside hospital. allergies: no known drug allergies. social history: patient lives alone in , but prior to her transfer here, had been living at the transitional care unit after her adrenal gland biopsy. patient has a daughter and son, who are active in her care. her daughters name is , phone number and is her healthcare proxy. also has a sister and son, who are close to her. physical examination: patient is afebrile, blood pressure 8139, heart rate 120, saturating 100 percent on nonrebreather. in general, she was comfortable in no distress. heent exam: pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements are intact, mucous membranes were dry. neck: supple, nontender, no increase in jvd. lungs: crackles at the bases left greater than right. cardiovascular: tachycardic with normal s1 and s2 and a 26 systolic murmur at the apex. abdomen: soft, nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds. extremities: no edema. two plus dorsalis pedis pulses present bilaterally. neurologic is alert and oriented times three and moves all extremities with no focal deficits. labs at outside hospital: white blood cell count was 5.9, hematocrit was 28.3, platelets were 58, which appears to be the patients baseline. sodium 130, potassium 4.0, chloride 93, bicarb 25, bun 20, creatinine 1.5, previously 3.1 on , glucose 110. calcium 8.3. ck 20 and troponin negative per outside hospital emergency department. urinalysis showed small bilirubin, trace ketones, large blood, 30 protein, negative nitrite, moderate leukocyte esterase, 25-30 white cells, red cells, 2 plus bacteria, and moderate epithelials. chest x-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates increased consistent with . chest and abdominal ct on showed bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos exposure, calcified mitral annulus, large adrenal masses 7.5 cm on the left and 6 cm on the right consistent with metastases, enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, largest was 2.5 cm on the right and 2 cm on the left and multiple colonic diverticula. ekg at the outside hospital was sinus tachycardic at 150 beats per minute, 0.5- depressions in i and avl, left axis deviation, no q waves. assessment: this is an 83-year-old female with recent acute renal failure and a new diagnosis of bilateral adrenal masses, who presents with fever and tachycardia and hypotension. hospital course: 1. hypotension: patients hypotension was thought to be most likely due to early sepsis most probably from a urinary tract infection given her fever and positive urinalysis. even though patient was diuresed at the outside hospital, it is most likely that she was hypovolemic, which would be explained by her tachycardia and hypotension. since she did not receive adequate fluid resuscitation at the outside hospital, the patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated in the medical intensive care unit with as much as 3 liters of iv fluids and blood pressure stabilized in the systolics of 90s to low 100s. patients pressors were weaned to off in the medical intensive care unit as mentioned in the history of present illness, and her o2 saturations remained stable at 100 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula. upon transfer to the medicine floor, patients cultures remained negative from blood and urine. patient is continued on levofloxacin and the vancomycin was discontinued since there was no obvious indication for continuing vancomycin. given the patients septic picture, would recommend a 10 day course total for levofloxacin. patient will need five more days of levofloxacin to complete the 10 day course. patients blood pressures upon discharge had been in the low 100s, which most probably is the patients baseline blood pressure, and she has been hemodynamically stable. there is question of whether her hypotension may have been secondary to adrenal insufficiency, and this will be addressed below. 1. oxygen requirement: the patient had an oxygen requirement through most of her hospitalization, although upon discharge, her o2 saturations have been 94 percent on room air and 94 percent on room air after ambulation. it was thought initially that patient had mild chf, which was consistent with chest x-ray findings. however, patient did not show florid stigmata of heart failure on examination. in addition, the patient had a 2-d echocardiogram performed on , which revealed a normal systolic function and ef of greater than 55 percent with no abnormalities except for mild 1 plus mr. did have cks and troponins cycled, which were negative for mi. given her o2 requirement, patient had a chest ct performed on , which was performed without contrast, and revealed small bilateral pleural effusions, multiple calcified pleural plaques on the right and left pleural surfaces most probably consistent with prior asbestos exposure. there is also a focal calcified granuloma within the right middle lobe, but no other discrete pulmonary nodules and no intraparenchymal mass lesions. she also had linear opacities right greater than left in the bases consistent with scarring. the ct also had cuts of the adrenal glands, which showed bilateral soft tissue densities in the adrenal glands right measuring 6.9 x 4.3 cm and the left measuring 4.1 x 4.2 cm. with these chest ct findings as well as the ct findings at the outside hospital, it is most likely that patient has had prior asbestos exposure and may have pleural plaques resulting from this. after speaking to family, the patient has apparently had a history of this granuloma in the past, and even had a thoracotomy performed, although further details are not available. since the patients o2 saturations have been stable on room air, felt comfortable that her pulmonary status is stable. 1. bilateral adrenal masses and question of adrenal insufficiency: the patient had an outside hospital biopsy performed, which was concerning for carcinoma. the final immunohistochemistry stains would not be back prior to discharge since they were sent out from the outside hospital. there were no indications of metastasis on chest ct. but the final diagnosis of what type of cancer patient may have is still not available at this time. on admission, patients family notified the micu team that patient, herself was not aware of the diagnosis of bilateral adrenal masses. during her stay during the medicine , a family meeting was called to inform the patient about her bilateral adrenal masses and the possibility of carcinoma. patient still does not seem to quite understand her diagnosis at this time, but patient has a very good primary care followup with dr. . dr. number is . patient also has an outpatient oncologist, dr. , who will follow up with the patient as an outpatient regarding the final immunohistochemistry stain and diagnosis and further treatment options. as far as the question of adrenal insufficiency, endocrine consult was called regarding patients steroid taper. they suggested tapering her steroids from hydrocortisone 50 q.6 to 50 q.8 hours, and then dropping prednisone to 30 mg on and then 20 mg on . upon discharge, the patient should continue with this prednisone taper, and should likely be tapered to 10 mg on and 7.5 mg on , and should continue with 7.5 mg of prednisone until her outpatient endocrine follow-up appointment, which will be made by her primary care physician, . . patient did have stim test checked on , but this was in light of hydrocortisone levels and her cortisol levels were 94.2 and then 88.4. the endocrine consult had recommended stim test even in the light of hydrocortisone therapy. on prior to patients 20 mg dose, an a.m. cortisol and acth was checked, and these results are still pending. it was still unclear if the patient has a primary adrenal insufficiency at this time since she has conflicting data. on prior to adrenal biopsy, the patient did have an elevated potassium and low sodium levels, but her random cortisol checked at that time was normal at the outside hospital at 17. however, patient did present with hypotension on , but her k at that time at the outside hospital was normal going against primary adrenal insufficiency. it is possible that her hypotension may all have been secondary to sepsis and it is difficult to interpret the low cortisol level of 13, that was drawn at that time in the setting of an acute infection. in addition, patient has been on high-dosed steroids now, and the likelihood that she will become adrenally insufficient is probable. the masses in the adrenal glands in films do not help indicate adrenal insufficiency since this may likely be metastasis as well from lymphomas or lung carcinoma. thus, at this time, patient will continue as mentioned above with a prednisone taper of 20 mg on mg on , 7.5 mg on , and continue with those until outpatient endocrine followup. she will continue with fludrocortisone 0.05 mg p.o. q.d. times a total seven day course to end on . an a.m. cortisol and acth are still pending from , and this should be followed up with her primary care physician. addition, endocrine consult requested a 24-hour urine collection for metanephrines, bma, and catecholamines to rule out pheochromocytoma, however, this was determined this could be done as an outpatient. the pheochromocytoma was the most unlikely. 1. increased blood sugars: the patient had high blood sugars at the start of her steroid therapy, which have begun to decrease given her taper of steroids. she has not required as much insulin at the time of discharge, but she will still require q.i.d. fingersticks given that she is still on a prednisone taper. it was attempted to teach the patient diabetic teaching with insulin, however, patient has difficulty understanding how to administer the insulin. she will need assistance with insulin teaching and diabetes management while she is on the prednisone taper. 1. hypothyroidism: the patient had an elevated tsh at 8.3, t4 of 6.4, and t3 of 54. endocrine consult did comment on these values, and decided that the tsh was uninterpretable in the setting of acute infection. patient should have a tsh repeated in weeks by her primary care physician. 1. acute renal failure: patients creatinine was elevated on admission to 1.7 at the outside hospital, although it had been as high as 3.1 on . upon discharge, patients creatinine is now 1.4 and has been stable. patient often requires additional fluids to supplement her p.o. intake, and patient may have a component of prerenal in her acute renal failure. a fena and urine electrolytes were checked, and the fena was calculated to be 1.1 percent, which is not especially helpful in this setting. it is likely that patient may have had some atn with her episodes of hypotension in the beginning of and then again on , and patients renal tubules may be recovering from this insult. would recommend following patients creatinine frequently as an outpatient and supplementing while patient is in a rehab facility with iv fluids 1 liter every other day if patient appears dry on exam and is not taking sufficient p.o. the patient may likely have some element of chronic renal failure from the acute tubular necrosis, but this maybe patients new baseline creatinine. disposition: the patient will require either a skilled- nursing facility or rehab facility for help with insulin teaching as well as medication administration. physical therapy did work with the patient and felt that she was doing well from an ambulation and mobility standpoint. discharge diagnoses: 1. urosepsis. 2. hypotension. 3. bilateral adrenal masses. 4. possibility of adrenal insufficiency. 5. acute renal failure. 6. hyperglycemia. discharge condition: stable. discharge status: to skilled-nursing facility or rehab. discharge medications: 1. levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d. x5 more days. 2. heparin 5000 units subq q.8h. while patient is at rehab facility. 3. sliding scale insulin. 4. atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d. 5. senna. 6. colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 7. protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d. 8. prednisone taper 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. on and 7.5 mg on . 9. fludrocortisone 0.05 mg q.d. x3 more days. follow-up plans: 1. the patient should follow up with her primary care physician, . in one week. at this time, the patient will most likely have her immunohistochemistry stain results back from the adrenal mass biopsy. 2. the patient should follow up with her primary oncologist, dr. within

the injury was non operative. serial head ct scans were followed and were stable. he remained in the tsicu and initially was difficult to wean from the ventilator; the decision to perform a tracheostomy and placement of a peg tube was made. he underwent both procedures without any complications. he was eventually weaned from the ventilator. because of his head injury there were initially some behavioral problems; complicating this was his history of etoh use. he was placed on a ciwa protocol for alcohol withdrawal, this was discontinued after 9 days. haldol was started to help control his intermittent episodes of agitation; this was found to be very helpful. his mental status and behavior improved over the next several days. physical and occupational therapy were consulted and have recommended rehab after hospital stay. he will need a speech and swallow evaluation once at rehab for passy muir and swallowing eval. he will follow up with dr. in clinic in weeks for possible removal of his trach and peg if he passes the speech and swallow evaluation. medications on admission: coumadin vasotec 2.5 qd coreg 12.5 asa discharge medications: 1. therapeutic multivitamin liquid sig: five (5) ml po daily (daily). 2. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unitml solution sig: one (1) ml injection (2 times a day). 3. bisacodyl 10 mg suppository sig: one (1) suppository rectal hs (at bedtime) as needed for constipation. 4. docusate sodium 50 mg5 ml liquid sig: ten (10) mls po bid (2 times a day). 5. nicotine 21 mg24 hr patch 24 hr sig: one (1) patch 24 hr transdermal daily (daily). 6. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg tablet sig: 0.5 tablet po tid (3 times a day): hold fro hr 60;

date: discharge date: date of birth: sex: f service: chief complaint: congestive heart failure, non st elevation myocardial infarction. history of present illness: this is a 75 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who developed a cough five days prior to admission. she was started on antibiotics one day prior to admission secondary to being short of breath. the patient was at an outside hospital on , was intubated, became hypotensive and started on dopamine, briefly found to be pulseless in the field. at that time, echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 percent with anterior hypokinesis. ck checked at that time was 3000, mb was 60, troponin was 2.6. an emergent catheterization showed patent grafts, however, severe congestive heart failure with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34. on admission to the patient was found to be in cardiogenic shock with a low cardiac output and high svr. cardiac output improved on dopamine although the patient developed atn and shock liver with ast in the 10,000 range. urine output improved on vasopressin. on , the patient was transitioned to milrinone and levophed but was tachy to the 140s and hypotensive. the patient then developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate versus atrial tachycardia without any response to adenosine. the patient was cardioverted on amiodarone but the amiodarone drip was discontinued secondary to liver failure. the numbers on were more consistent with sepsis with a cardiac output of 5.0 and an svr of 704. the patient was switched back to levophed and dopamine and then titrated off dopamine. on , the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 170s with shocks times two and loaded on digoxin. throughout this course, the patient has been on broad antibiotics for a questionable sepsis. past medical history: 1. significant for coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in . 2. questionable diet controlled diabetes mellitus. 3. hypertension. 4. hypercholesterolemia. 5. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 6. status post mitral valve replacement, bioprosthetic valve. medications: 1. nitroglycerine. 2. aspirin. 3. pletal 100 q day. 4. lasix 20 q day. 5. protonix 40 twice a day. 6. lopressor 25 three times a day. 7. lisinopril 5 q day. 8. pravachol 80 q day. 9. pulmicort. 10.serevent. 11.albuterol three puffs four times a day. laboratory data: cardiac catheterization at the outside hospital on showed right atrial pressure of 16, left ventricular end diastolic of 21; pulmonary artery pressures 5133; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 34. left main coronary artery with mild disease. left anterior descending with diffuse disease. left circumflex with mild disease; right coronary artery with proximal total occlusion; saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and left anterior descending were patent. hospital course by systems: 1. coronary artery disease: no significant lesions in graft on catheterization. ck was elevated 3000 and mb of 60; the mb index was around 5 percent. the patient was started on aspirin and started on a statin when her liver function tests improved. 1. pump: repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 percent with global left ventricular hypokinesis. initial concern was for cardiogenic shock; however, the patient continued to spike fevers and physiology was more concerning for sepsis. managed with broad spectrum antibiotics for a two week course. the patient remained tachycardic during most of the hospital course. once the pressors were weaned, able to initiate an ace inhibitor and low dose beta blocker and titrate as tolerated by blood pressure. 1. rhythm: atrial fibrillation versus supraventricular tachycardia versus atrial arrhythmia. heart rate elevated to the 170s on . initially controlled with carotid massage; given 12 mg of adenosine without significant effect. on , systolic blood pressure was in the 70s, heart rate was in the 170s. the patient was shocked times two, given bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, titrated up on levophed and started on digoxin. the patient needed anti-arrhythmic loading but limited by hepatic toxicity and blood pressures, so therefore the patient was started on digoxin. when liver function tests improved, the patient was subsequently placed on amiodarone and was subsequently in sinus rhythm. 1. hypotension: initially presumed to be cardiogenic, but hemodynamics later were more consistent with sepsis and blood pressure and cardiac output improved with fluid boluses. the patient was weaned off levophed but exquisitely sensitive to small changes in dose questionably thought to be secondary to autonomic dysfunction. random cortisol was 6 and improved to 22 on corticotropin stim test. the patient was treated with hydrocortisone times seven days, given low random cortisol but not thought to be adrenally insufficient. hypotension improved with volume. the patient was able to be weaned from pressors. blood pressure stabilized and the patient was able to be started on low dose ace inhibitor and beta blocker. 1. infectious disease: persistent fevers, septic physiology. a chest x-ray was without infiltrate. urinalysis remained negative. blood cultures were negative to date. concern for sepsis given increased cardiac output and dropping svr. the patient was continued on vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl for broad coverage empirically times two weeks on the antibiotics which were renally dosed. surveillance blood and fungal cultures were negative. after a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics, the patient started to produce sputum positive for e. coli. the patient was treated with a two week course of ceftaz (cultured e. coli was found to be fluoroquinolone resistant) with the improvement in white blood cell count and downward trend in fever curve. the pathogen was thought to be from a new ventilator acquired pneumonia versus prior infectious etiology for sepsis. 1. gastrointestinal: evidence of shock liver with transaminases in the 10,000 range and concerning for bowel ischemia given guaiac positive stools. right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed without any gross abnormalities. as perfusion formed, liver function tests normalized and bowel function returned. given the concern for guaiac positive stools, the patient had an egd and colonoscopy. egd showed a 1 to 2 centimeter mass in the esophagus and mild gastritis in the stomach body. colonoscopy showed non-bleeding rectal ulcer thought to be the cause of the guaiac positive stools. hematocrit at the time of discharge was stable. 1. nutrition: once bowel function returned, the patient was started on tube feeds to assist her catabolic state. once extubated, speech and swallow evaluation ultimately cleared the patient for taking a regular diet. at the time of discharge the patient was tolerating p.o. intake. 1. pulmonary: evidence of congestive heart failure by chest x-ray and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. oxygenation has not been an issue during this hospital course. the patient was intubated prior to arrival and extubated on , oxygenating and ventilating well. she received a two week course of antibiotics with ceftazidine for e. coli pneumonia. 1. renal: acute renal failure atn from shock. post atn diuresis. the patients creatinine improved. at the time of discharge, the renal function was stable. 1. thrombocytopenia: first noted on . hit antibody was negative, however, h2 blocker was stopped. there was no evidence of dic. the patient was restarted on subcutaneous heparin and platelets remained stable throughout the remainder of her hospital course. 1. neurologic: the patient remained sedated for much of the hospital course and minimally responsive. sedative medications (versed and fentanyl) were discontinued for 96 hours without significance starting on . at that point, there was no significant improvement in mental status. the thought was that the patient had taken large hit to liver and renal function secondary to sepsis shock. since many of these medications are hepatically metabolized and renally cleared, it was thought that the patient was not clearing these medications quickly. the patient was started on dilantin with thoughts that there may have been seizure activity; however, this did not seem to make acute improvements in mental status. towards the end of the hospital course, the patients mental status improved. the patient was more awake and alert, interactive at the time of discharge. the patient demonstrated marked weakness secondary to immobilization, however, neurologically intact. 1. diabetes mellitus: the patient was given a regular insulin sliding scale. 1. peripheral vascular disease: the patient was status post right femoral-popliteal bypass. to continue aspirin and pletal. 1. fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: the patients electrolytes were monitored and ultimately she was started on tube feeds. at the time of discharge she was tolerating p.o. 1. code status: at the time of presentation, the patient was full code and during hospital course the patient was changed to do not resuscitate. at the time of extubation, the patient was changed to do not resuscitate, do not intubate. disposition: the patient was discharged on to an extended care facility. condition on discharge: good. discharge diagnoses: 1. congestive heart failure with systolic and diastolic dysfunction. 2. cardiogenic shock. 3. coronary artery disease. 4. atrial fibrillation requiring shock and chemical cardioversion. 5. acidosis. 6. septic shock. 7. escherichia coli pneumonia. 8. acute renal failure. 9. ischemic hepatitis. 10. respiratory failure. 11. gastrointestinal bleed. 12. thrombocytopenia. invasive procedure: 1. intubation and extubation. 2. central line placement. 3. picc line placement. 4. eeg. 5. cardioversion times two. discharge medications: 1. flovent two puffs twice a day. 2. serevent one puff twice a day. 3. albuterol metered dose inhaler, two puffs q six as needed. 4. atrovent two puffs q four to six as needed. 5. senna, one tablet p.o. twice a day. 6. miconazole powder, one application three times a day. 7. lipitor 10 mg p.o. q day. 8. spironolactone 25 mg p.o. once a day. 9. protonix 40 mg p.o. twice a day. 10. aspirin 81 mg p.o. once a day. 11. metoprolol 25 mg p.o. twice a day. 12. lisinopril 5 mg p.o. once a day. 13. amiodarone 200 mg p.o. once a day. 14. lasix 40 mg p.o. twice a day. 15. ceftazidine, two grams intravenously q. 12 hours times one day. 16. insulin sliding scale. discharge instructions: 1. followup with primary care physician, . in one to two weeks. 2. followup with cardiologist dr. in one to two weeks. 3. followup with gi in two to three weeks for biopsy results. 4. the patient will have monitoring of pulmonary function

normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. no masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. the mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. no mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. there is a small pericardial effusion. rle us: normal flow, augmentation, compressibility and waveforms are demonstrated. no intraluminal thrombus is identified. brief hospital course: assessment: 60yo woman with no known pmh presented with abdominal sx (pain, diarrhea, vomiting) and fever, constitutional sx, found to have dm and group a strep bacteremia. hospital course is detailed below by problem: 1. hyperglycemiapresumed dkanew onset dm - although the patient had no prior history, she has a strong family history and presented w diarrhea, hypovolemia, fs 400, ketonuria, and glucosuria. she most likely had previously poor control of her blood glucose with deterioration in the setting of an acute infection. hba1c was 13.4. in the icu, she was begun on glargine and sliding scale insulin. she was changed to metformin, as she was not thought to be able to give herself insulin every day, and had a good response. she was also begun on an ace-i. her medication regimen will likely need to be further addressed as an outpatient when her infection has cleared. in the hospital, she received teaching about the diabetic diet and blood glucose monitoring. her daughter has diabetes and expressed that she would help her mother with her fingersticks. 2. group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus bacteremia - during the hospitalization, the patient was found to have blood cultures positive for group a strep bacteremia. this was treated with pcn g iv 4mu q4h. given the bacteremia, tte and tee were done and showed no evidence of endocarditis. it was somewhat surprising that the patient continued to have leukocytosis despite adequate iv antibiotics, with a peak wbc of 21.8. further studies, however, including the tee, a neck mri, cxr, and multiple cultures, did not show any evidence of abscess, malignancy, or other untreated infection. by discharge, the wbc had fallen to 13. in addition, the patient had no further complaints and better glycemic control. 3. metabolic syndrome - the patient fits criteria : increased fbg and central obesity. blood pressures were stable throughout the course of her hospital stay, lipid panel was checked and was within normal limits with the exception of a decreased hdl. she should be encouraged to follow a good diet and exercise regularly. she was started on asa for prophylaxis of mistroke given multiple risk factors, including dm and obesity. 4. hypokalemiahypomagnesemiahypophosphatemiahypocalcemia - on admission, the patient was noted to have significant electrolyte abnormalities. these were most likely due to dka and gi loss, and resolved throughout her hospitalization. 5. abdominal complaints - these were most likely a result of the patients dka, all stool studies were negative. the symptoms resolved early in the admission. due to guaiac emesis, she had an ng tube placed. this was removed without complication; in fact, she noted resolution of her throat pain with removal of the ngt. 6. mild anemia with decreased mcv - during the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have anemia. a guaiac positive emesis was thought to be secondary to inflammation and irritation from ngt placement. her stools were guaiac negative on discharge. her hct slowly trended down over the course of the hospitalization, though it seemed to remain stable during the last several days. it was thought that this was mostly secondary to hemodilution, as the patient had no acute source of bleeding. iron studies showed a pattern suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, the underlying cause was not known, but may have been poorly controlled diabetes. 7. thrombocytopenia - while in the icu, the patients platelets trended downward with a low of 104. subsequently, she had resolution without intervention, with her platelets on discharge stable in the 200s. 8. altered mental status - initially, this was likely secondary to dka and infection. csf cultures were negative, head ct was negative. when the acute issues were resolved, however, it became clear that the patient also had an underlying low cognitive function, most likely a lifelong issue. this can be addressed as an outpatient 9. sore throat - during the hospitalization, the patient began complaining of pain in her throatneck. an mri was done to rule out abscess. upon further inspection, it was determined that the cause of her pain was irritation from the ng tube, so it was discontinued. at this time, the patient did not have any problems tolerating intake. medications on

an eus suggested transmural involvement. she is otherwise a reasonable candidate for resection. we felt it important to define her specific surgical stage before deciding regarding chemotherapy and radiation. therefore, a resection was recommended and we initially planned a transhiatal esophagectomy. this also would require feeding jejunostomy. her methotrexate given for rheumatoid arthritis was

date: discharge date: date of birth: sex: f service: chief complaint: respiratory distress. history of present illness: the patient is a 49-year-old african american female with history of chronic bronchitis who was found by her family earlier tonight. they found her cyanotic and unresponsive. they called 911 and when she was found by ems, she was not moving air at all. she has albuterol at home but does not use it much. when she arrived at the emergency room, she could not move enough air to receive nebulizer treatment and she was intubated. she received etomidate, succinylcholine, fentanyl, ativan, and magnesium sulfate in the emergency room. she also received solu-medrol 103 mg iv in the emergency room. according to her family, she has been short of breath for a few days. she called her primary care physician who prescribed an antibiotic, possibly bactrim, four days ago. past medical history: chronic bronchitis, about 2 flares two times per year, but she has never been hospitalized for it. medications: albuterol, last use approximately a year ago and then again a few days ago. sulfa antibiotic for four days. social history: two packs per day smoking for past 25 years. she is a current smoker. allergies: no known drug allergies. social history: she lives with her husband, she has no children. she is a bank receptionist. family history: sister with asthma which is mild. physical examination: temperature 99.9, heart rate 110, blood pressure 12264. after the succinylcholine and etomidate blood pressure dropped to 80-90. her respiratory rate was 40. she was satting at 97-100% on non rebreather. in general she was sitting up, unable to speak. she was then intubated. cardiovascular, tachycardic, lungs with equal breath sounds bilaterally, tight air movement, no rhonchorous sounds. abdomen soft, non distended, positive bowel sounds. extremities, no edema, weak pulses. rectal guaiac positive. laboratory data: white count 18.0, neutrophils 75,

7.15 ph, pco2 104, po2 139 which was post intubation abg. she was on assist control, respiratory rate 10, total volume 400, peep 10. her chest x-ray showed clear lung fields. assessmentplan: this was a 49-year-old female who was thought to be in acute asthma. she was most likely in status asthmaticus. she required multiple sedative agents because she was fighting intubation. hospital course: she was admitted to the intensive care unit after being intubated. 1. pulmonary: the patient was brought up to the intensive care unit because she was in respiratory failure. she was thought to be in status asthmaticus. also on differential was anaphylactic attack but the only new medication she was on was the bactrim. however, she was on it for multiple days and is unlikely to be an allergic reaction. it is unclear what precipitated the event but she was treated for status asthmaticus. she was given continuous nebulizers with atrovent and albuterol. she was also started on solu-medrol 80 mg iv tid. she was started on heliox for improved oxygenation. cultures were taken. though the chest x-ray was clear, she did have fever and elevated white blood count. she was treated empirically initially with levofloxacin. she was continued on versed and fentanyl to keep her sedated on the intubation. total volume was increased to 500 and she was on assist control respiratory rate of 10 and fio2 was increased eventually to 30%. the nebulizers were given q one hour. her abg showed that she is in respiratory acidosis and the acidemia are going to be corrected slowly. she had increased peak inspiratory pressures most likely from her fighting the intubation. she required increased amounts of sedation involving ativan and fentanyl. there was some concern for auto peep considering her peak inspiratory pressure was elevated. they followed her. abgs were followed for evidence of auto peep. on the second day of admission, her abg was 7.26, pco2 64 and po2 90. the goal was to keep her ph at 7.2 and to increase it slowly. on the third day of admission, her abg showed that she had ph 7.28, carbon dioxide 61 and oxygen 129. she was thought to be hypercarbic. on the fourth day of admission, her abg was 7.38, pco2 47, po2 202. her ph had normalized. she was thought to have been auto peeping secondary to her bronchospasms. she was begun weaning on the fourth or fifth day of admission. however, she was not able to have spontaneous breaths. consequently she arrested on assist control. her sedation was then weaned to try to see if she would have spontaneous breaths. her abg on the 6th day of admission was 7.4150159. on that day, her solu-medrol was decreased the patient 80 mg iv bid as she had improved air movement. her vent settings, she was on intermittent mechanical ventilation with pressure support. her total volume was set at 550 and respiratory rate was set at 12. her fio2 was 40%. she was slowly improving. on the 7th day of admission, her blood gas was 7.44, pco2 54 and po2 89. she was now on respiratory rate set at 8 with spontaneous breaths. her total volume was 550. she was still on imv. it was felt that she is hypercapnic at baseline after it could not be fully corrected. it was thought that the patient had auto peep and may have been interfering with her ventilation. her peep was increased to 10. the goal was to see if patient could initiate her own breaths more frequently. throughout this whole time she was continued on the steroids and the bronchodilators. she was also on levofloxacin. on the 8th day of admission, the patient had a difficult time weaning off. her pressure support was reduced from 15 to 10. it was found from her husband, that she most likely has obstructive sleep apnea and she would need follow-up after her issues had resolved. her failure to wean was thought to be secondary to volume overload. she had been receiving large amounts of fluid for this decreased urine output but was most likely volume overloaded. she was diuresing on her own. on the 8th day of admission she had been started on a prednisone taper. she was on pressure support. she was attempted to be extubated on the , she was successfully extubated. she tolerated it well. she was started on prednisone and she was started on a prednisone taper. she was started on albuterol and atrovent and flovent inhalers. completion of this discharge summary is

issues, up to the transfer to the floor. when the patient was transferred to the floor, she had a pulmonary consult just as followup since she had severe asthma and to establish future care for her. she was seen by the pulmonary consult team. they recommended checking pulmonary function tests, checking her o2, weaning it down to appropriate levels. they also recommended repleting her potassium to help normalize her metabolic alkalosis. they also recommended checking her peak flow. her pulmonary function tests were checked on the second day of her stay on the floor. her fvc was 1.61, which was 50% predicted. her fev-1 was 0.54, which was 22% predicted. her fev-1 to fvc ratio was 44% of predicted. after taking the medication, she did not have much change of her fev-1 to fvc ratio. she had a diffusion test which showed that it was 24% of predicted. overall, the patient had good effort. her pulmonary function tests were consistent with an obstructive pattern without much reactive airway disease at this time. the patient was to follow up with pulmonary clinic with dr. on at 10:45 a.m. 2. cardiac. the patient did not have any ischemic events initially during the course of her admission. her electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. she did have initial hypertension in the setting of getting sedatives and most likely also due to hypovolemia. she was given aggressive volume resuscitation with normal saline. her sedation was titrated to reduce the chance of hypotension. hypertension was thought most likely secondary to hypovolemia. on the third day of her admission, she did have intermittent periods of bradycardia, which were thought secondary to sedation. she had been difficult to wean off the ventilator. her thyroid levels were checked in the setting of her bradycardia. on the fourth day of admission, she continued to have poor urine output. in the setting of poor r wave progressions on her electrocardiogram and her poor urine output, she was sent for an echocardiogram. the tsh came back at 0.13. t4 was 3.7 and t3 was 33. her echocardiogram had shown an ejection fraction greater than 55%, tricuspid regurgitation gradient to 20 mmhg. left atrium was normal size. left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size are normal. low normal left ventricular systolic function. right ventricle is dilated with moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis with 1 mitral regurgitation. she had a low tsh and a low free t4, consistent with essential hypothyroidism. she had a mri to evaluate for pituitary for this hypothyroidism. because of her slight heart failure, she was given lasix to improve her urine output. the mri was obtained but patient was agitated and it was not an entirely great study. it had no abnormalities shown. the right ventricular heart failure was thought secondary to pulmonary hypertension from likely cor pulmonale secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or obstructive sleep apnea. she did not receive any thyroid replacement. she continued to receive fluids. on the seventh day of admission she had episode of tachycardia. this may have been from her hypovolemia. she was given lasix 10 mg iv on a p.r.n. basis to improve her urine output. the lasix was not continued on the floors. she had no ischemic events thus far. 3. infectious disease. the patient had low-grade fever on admission. she was pancultured and did not have any positive culture data initially. blood culture, sputum culture, and urine culture were all sent. she was initially treated with levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia, possibly bronchitis. she continued to be on levofloxacin but had no evidence of positive cultures. her chest x-ray did not reveal any evidence of pneumonia. however, she had improving white blood counts. on the fifth day of admission, she had a temperature spike of 101 degrees fahrenheit. her culture data again was still negative. initially the thought was to wait for further culture data before changing her antibiotic regimen. when her mri was taken to assess her pituitary, she was found to have pansinusitis on the mri. for the sinusitis, she was started on ceftazidime and metronidazole and the levofloxacin was continued. ent was consulted, and they felt that the changes were most consistent with a chronic sinusitis and not an acute sinusitis. they did not feel that any drainage was necessary. she did not need to be treated with antibiotics. subsequently, the ceftazidime and metronidazole were discontinued. otherwise the patient was just continued on the levofloxacin, and she did not have any further temperature spikes. fever origin was not known. her cultures remained negative. 4. endocrine. the patient had evidence of right-sided heart failure. she also had her thyroid checked, and her initial values were found to be hypothyroid. she was bradycardic and had hypokinesis on the echocardiogram with exophthalmos on examination. she had thyroid function tests. her tsh was 0.13, her t4 was 3.7 and t3 was 33. she had a mri which did not reveal any evidence of pituitary lesion. her thyroid function tests were repeated. the repeat thyroid function tests showed normalization. they were within normal limits. she did not require any further repletion with thyroid hormone. she was covered during this admission particularly because she was on solu-medrol and now prednisone. 5. renal. the patient had poor urine output during much of the admission. this was thought most likely secondary to hypovolemia. she received much fluid during this admission. she became hypernatremic on the second day of admission with a sodium of 147. this was all thought to be due to hypovolemia. it was thought that the hypernatremia developed also in the setting of fluid repletion and the normal sodium load. she had a fractional sodium that was suggestive of dehydration. her urine output was still poor on the third day of admission. she continued with fluids. her urine sodium was less than 10 on repeat. she continued to receive fluid boluses. on the fifth day of admission, her urine output was 805 ml and she was 2874 ml for that day. at this stage she was 18 liters positive. finally, on the fifth day of admission she was started on lasix 10 mg iv. her response to this was improved urine output. over a 24-hour period she increased her urine output to 1300 ml. she was -275. she was positive for 17 liters. through the stay, her creatinine was mildly increasing but never rose very high. she seems to have peaked at approximately 0.5. her bun did increase, though, suggestive of dehydration. with lasix, the patient had increased urine output. on the seventh day of admission, her urine output increased to -3335 ml. this was in the setting of receiving lasix. she then was in the process of autodiuresing. her output over 24 hours was 4000 on the eighth day of admission. her urine output had really improved, and she was no longer thought to be so dehydrated. her urine output on the last day of her unit stay was 3360 ml. she was in the setting of autodiuresing. no more lasix was given during the rest of her admission. 6. hematology. the patient had guaiac-positive stool during this admission. she also had an elevated inr of 1.3. she was given vitamin k initially subcutaneously times one. it was thought to be secondary to poor nutrition. she was started on protonix. her hematocrit was watched during the course of the admission. it decreased from 46.8 on admission to 36.4 to 31.8 on the third day of admission. this was thought most likely secondary to dilution. her hematocrit on the next day was 33.1. her hematocrit from there on remained relatively stable. she will need a follow-up colonoscopy when she is more stable or when her acute pulmonary issues have improved. the patient is to be discharged to rehab as she has become deconditioned. she is discharged on the following medications. discharge medications: 1. protonix 40 mg p.o. every day. 2. albuterol two puffs every four hours p.r.n. for dyspnea. 3. atrovent two puffs q.i.d. 4. flovent 110 mcg four puffs b.i.d. 5. levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. every day to be ended on . 6. regular insulin sliding scale. 7. prednisone taper to end on . she will follow up with dr. in the pulmonary clinic on at 10:45 a.m. she will need to be followed up for her asthma and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. the patient is to be discharged to rehab. she is in fair condition. discharge diagnoses: 1. status asthmaticus 2. right-sided heart failure 3. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , m.d. dictated by: medquist36 d: 20:01 t: 20:03 job:"

freeca-1.21 brief hospital course: the patient was brought to the operating room and underwent mediastinoscopy and vats lulectomy, as described in dr. operative report. she was kept in the pacu overnight, and required pressor support initially. her post op cxr showed pneumothorax and extensive sub-q emphysema, so an additional chest tube was placed. this tube put out 300 cc of fairly bloody output upon placement. she was then admitted to the icu on pod 1, due to her blood pressure. she did well there, and her pressor requirement was weaned off. on the night of pod 1, she had an episode of acute delirium, which was controlled with anxiolytics and antipsychotic medications. she was monitored for alcohol withdrawal. she was transferred to the floor on pod 2 and did fairly well there. she had one episode of mild confusion and medication refusal, but this resolved on its own. when her chest tube was placed to water seal on pod 4, a pneumothorax reaccumulated, so it was put back to suction. throughout the admission pain was controlled with a thoracic epidural, until pod 5, when she was transitioned to po pain medication. once on the floor she did much better, having her drains removed on pod 4, her chest tube was ddced on pod 5, with the resulting pneumothorax described above. she was discharged home on pod 6 tolerating food, on oral pain medication with all her tubes dc

compresses the left kidney medially. multiple foci of active extravasation are demonstrated within the left perinephric space. the hematoma extends to the retroperitoneum bilaterally. 2. the left renal vein at the left hilum is not well visualized, and this may be due to compression of the vein by the left perinephric hematoma or formation of thrombus within this region. 3. both kidneys enhance symmetrically. bilateral renal cysts and renal calculi are demonstrated without evidence of hydronephrosis. 4. small amount of hemoperitoneum noted within the perihepatic space likely related to the large retroperitonal hematoma. 5. bibasilar atelectasis with small left pleural effusion. angio : 1. selective left renal arteriography revealed active contrast extravasation from two areas arising from the cortical surface of the lower half of the left kidney. 2. successful superselective gelfoam embolization of three left renal artery branches where the extravasation was identified, with good immediate angiographic results. 3. selective left l1, l2, and l3 lumbar arteriography without evidence of extravasation or vascular abnormality. 4. left iliac arteriography was performed and showed no evidence of extravasation or vascular abnormality from the branches of the hypogastric, external iliac, or common femoral arteries. cxr : decrease of bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis. left lower lobe opacity, probably representing atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be totally excluded. brief hospital course: neuro: mr. was admitted to the tsicu after undergoing an angiogram with embolization for his left kidney fracture. he was placed on a ciwa scale, ativan as needed and dilaudid for the pain. the patient developed delirium tremens with severe tremors, agitation and was tachycardic to 140s on hd2 refractory to ativan, metoprolol, ivf boluses. the patient was sedated and intubated until hd13. once extubated, the patient was placed on oral pain medications with good results. renal: the patients angiogram revealed bleeding cortical vessels. this was embolized with gelfoam. repeat hematocrit levels showed moderate drops corrected with a series of blood transfusions. a repeat angiogram did not reveal further bleeding. an ivc filter was placed for his history of dvt. cv: the patient was placed on metoprolol with good control on his hypertension. an echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction. he was also placed in lasix for diureses as his fluid balance remained positive in the initial phase of his hospitalization. a clonidine patch was also added to his regimen. a lower extremity ultrasound did not reveal any dvt. pulm: the patient developed atelectasis and consolidation in the left lower lobe during his icu stay requiring a course of antibiotics. he was weaned off the ventilator on hd13 with no complications after failed prior attempts at extubation due to episodes of hypoxemia and tachypnea. id: the patient grew gram positive cocci from his arterial line after her spiked a fever at 101.7 on hd3. he was started on vancomycin and later on levofloxacin due to a possible infiltrate of the left lower lobe and staph coagulase negative growth in the urine. the vancomycin was discontinued on hd8 and replaced by clindamycin. levofloxacin was discontinued on hd10 and oxacillin was started once sputum culture sensitivities returned. on hd9, the patient developed herpetic lesions on his lips and was started on acyclovir. all antibiotics were discontinued on hd11. on , the patient developed a fever of 101.2. his right subclavian line was removed and sent for culture. urine and blood cultures remained negative. he developed a flare of his gout prior to discharge and treated with colchicine. ortho: the patients forehead laceration was sutured in the emergency department and his sutures were removed on hd6. no other issues were uncovered. etoh: the patient was under prophylaxis with ativan and, despite that, developed dts in the icu requiring intubation and sedation. this resolved after the initial few days of icu care. he remained stable in that aspect throughout his hospital stay thereafter. the patient discussed his drinking problem with , our social worker, and agreed to seek for help to overcome this problem. dispo: the patient was discharged in stable condition to a

date: discharge date: service: medicine history of present illness: mr. is an 82 year-old asian male with a history of dementia, who was transferred from the micu to the floor following a long stay for respiratory failure, complicated by fevers and complicated by bilateral iatrogenic pneumothoraces requiring chest tube placement. briefly the patient was admitted on following a respiratory and cardiac arrest after choking on food. the patient was resuscitated and intubated in the field by ems. estimated total time of arrest (cardiac and respiratory) was 5 to 15 minutes including 5 to 10 minutes of cpr. in the emergency department the patient received a left pneumothorax following an attempted left subclavian line placement. this left pneumothorax required a chest tube. the emergency department course is also notable for hypotension requiring levophed, as well as witnessed aspiration event. upon arrival to the complications of the left chest tube resulted in a left tented pneumothorax as well as a right sided pneumothorax presumed secondary to high pips in the 90s. the cardiac surgery was consulted and bilateral chest tubes were placed. the patient was initially begun on levofloxacinflagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia with bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray. the patient intermittently spiked fevers in the for which vancomycin was added on . in addition, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, which was responsive to adenosine and vagal maneuvers. a neurology consult was obtained who felt that anoxic brain injury was highly unlikely and his prognosis for recovery was poor. after an extensive discussion with the patients family the patients code status was changed to dnrdni. on the patient was extubated and bilateral chest tubes were discontinued. since the patient remained hemodynamically stable and the patient was transferred to the floor on . past medical history: 1. dementia of alzheimers type. 2. prior ceas. allergies:

power of attorney. the patients wife is living in she lives at home in . the patient has five children, four of whom who live locally and one who is in route to the hospital. physical examination on transfer: temperature 97.3. temperature max 99.6. heart rate 57. blood pressure 95 to 13035 to 60. respiratory rate 12 to 14. o2 saturation 100%. in general, the patient is unresponsive to verbal stimuli, but responsive to pain. coarse upper airway sounds are audible. cardiovascular distal heart sounds without murmurs. lungs very coarse breath sounds, positive upper airway noise, positive rhonchi. abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended. no masses, bowel sounds are positive. extremities bilateral upper extremities and bilateral lower extremities with marked edema. laboratory data on :

basilar lower lobe opacities right greater then left increasing over the past few days. microbiology: blood cultures times two, sputum is negative. urine is negative. blood cultures times two are negative. urine is with positive coag negative staph. electrocardiogram on normal sinus rhythm at 94 beats per minute, right bundle branch block, low limb voltage. impression: the patient is an 82 year-old asian male with baseline dementia who is initially admitted after a prolonged cardiacrespiratory arrest. he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with anoxic brain injury secondary to prolonged cardiac and respiratory arrest. in addition his hospital course was complicated by pneumothoraces as well as continued aspiration. a neurology consult was obtained to evaluate the patient and their overall consensus was that this patients prognosis was very poor. upon transfer to the floor the patient was currently aspirating with worsening bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, and the risk of recurrent arrest or decompensation was high. hospital course: 1. pulmonary: the patient continued aspirating. he remained on high oxygen flow by shovel mask. the was continued with supplemental oxygen with suctioning prn. 2. cardiovascular: the patient is hemodynamically stable, blood pressure in the 90 to 120 range. 3. infectious disease: afebrile times 48 hours with negative culture workup thus far. his fevers are likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitispneumonia versus central in origin. because of worsening infiltrates the patient was continued on aspiration coverage with levofloxacinflagyl. 4. renal: the patients bun to creatinine ratio was steadily increasing. this increasing ratio is likely indicated of a prerenal insufficiency. intravenous fluids were given to the patient to assist with the prerenal condition. 5. neurology: as per the neurological evaluation significant neurological recovery was very unlikely and the and patients prognosis was poor. 6. fen: the patients tube feeds were continued initially. 7. prophylaxis: the patient was kept on a ppi and subcutaneous heparin. 8. code status: a family meeting was carried out with the health care proxy, son and power of attorney daughter . the medical condition was discussed and at the patients current state he was at extremely high risk of decompensation and another cardiopulmonary arrest. the patient on transfer to the floor was dnrdni. a family meeting on with the son and daughter to represent the family. the medical condition and treatment were discussed in depth regarding dnrdni, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, deep oropharyngeal suction, laboratory draws, chest x-rays and blood cultures. stated that the family had already made peace with their fathers health condition and he voiced the preference that the patient be kept comfortable. also stated that he wished that his father would go peacefully with no intervention. and stated that they did not want any intravenous fluids or any pressors. it was decided by the family to discontinue all lines, intravenous fluids, with prn morphine given for comfort. in addition, the family declined deep oropharyngeal suctioning and laboratory draws. regarding feedings, daughter felt that the nasogastric tube feedings would not change anything and they opted to have the nasogastric tube feeds discontinued as well. the patients family stressed that the primary role is that the patient is to be kept comfortable and peaceful. a plan was made that the patient would be kept on supplemental oxygen for comfort, given prn morphine, oral suctioning as needed for comfort, as well as scopolamine patches to decrease secretions. from through the patient was kept comfortable with oxygen, morphine and prn tylenol. throughout his course the patient remained unresponsive, though the patient did once open his eyes to touch. the patients course continued to decline from through and he was without spontaneous movement. on the patient began having increased secretions, increased gurgling and his respiratory status became more labored. in addition, the patient began to have increased work of breathing. supplemental oxygen, scopolamine patches to decrease secretions and morphine gtt were continued for comfort. on at 12:17 p.m. the patient expired. discharge diagnoses: 1. dementia secondary to alzheimers disease. 2. aspiration of food causing cardiac arrest. 3. anoxic brain damage secondary to prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 4. continued aspiration pneumonitispneumonia. 5. iatrogenic pneumothorax status post subclavian line attempt. 6. left tension pneumothorax, secondary to displacement of left sided chest tube, which also resulted in a small right pneumothorax. 7. status post placement of bilateral

granuloma. at the left lung base is a linear high-density structure, which may represent a bullet fragment. the visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable. the noncontrast enhanced liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and left kidney are unremarkable. the right kidney contains a rounded low-density focus, which likely represents a simple renal cyst. the stomach, and intraabdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable. the patient is status ureteroileostomy and colostomy, and these loops of bowel are unremarkable. there is no evidence of bowel wall edema, or bowel obstruction. just inferior to the right kidney is a high- density metallic fragment, likely a bullet. there is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. there is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen. note is made of markedly atrophic back musculature. ct of the pelvis without contrast: the rectum and intrapelvic loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable. the patient is status post cystectomy. there is no pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy, and there is no free fluid within the pelvis. again, a high-density metallic fragment is noted within the right lower pelvis, likely a bullet. there are bilateral decubitus ulcers posterior to the lower pelvis and left and right hip joints. there is increased soft tissue density and air tracking from these decubitus ulcers into both hip joints. the patient is status post left femoral head resection in , however, there are marked irregularity and fragmentation about both hips which is concerning for chronic osteomyelitis in this region. bone windows: as described above, irregularity and fragmentation of both femurs and hip joints, some of which may be related on the left to the patients recent left femoral head resection. there are no suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesions. impression: marked irregularity and fragmentation of both femurs and hip joints with air and fluid tracking into these joints from the patients bilateral sacral decubitus ulcers. while on the left some of these changes could potentially be post operative secondary to the recent left femoral head resection, the severity of the joint and bone destruction is concerning for osteomyelitis bilaterally. liver or gallbladder us (single organ) 2:59 pm: comparison: ct of the abdomen dated . abdomen ultrasound: the liver echo texture is normal. there is a tiny calcification within the right lobe of the liver that likely represents a granuloma. there is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation or focal liver mass. the main portal vein is patent with the appropriate direction of flow. the gallbladder contains 2 shadowing gallstones. there is no gallbladder wall thickening, edema or pericholecystic fluid. common duct measures 5 mm. limited views of the pancreas are normal. conclusion: cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis. mr hip wwo contrast left 4:43 pm: hip without with gadolinium: the patient is post-girdlestone procedures bilaterally. there are soft tissue defects in the buttocks bilaterally packed with surgical gauze. there is abnormal enhancing soft tissue within the left gluteal soft tissues extending into the left iliac bone. the abnormal soft tissue extends to the medial aspect of the iliac bone but does not appear to extend into the pelvic cavity. the degree of abnormal soft tissue has increased compared with the prior study dated . within the posterior right buttock, there is soft tissue loss extending down to the right iliac bone which is new when compared with the prior study. abnormal enhancement is seen in this region as well. signal changes in the adjacent right illiac bone are non-specific, but are typical for osteomyelitis. there is diffuse edema within the gluteal soft tissues. a focal area of susceptibility is noted along the left perineum likely due to metallic susceptibility artifact. impression: post-girdlestone procedures bilaterally. interval worsening of the degree of soft tissue loss overlying the posterior right hip which extends down to and involves the right iliac bone. abnormal enhancing soft tissue extending into the left iliac bone, unchanged. the areas about both hips are concerning for osteomyelitis. pathology examination specimen submitted: acetabular bone,ileum

was transfered the pacu in stable conditon. post op. he was on the trauma service in the trauma sicu where he remained stable and was extubated. he was seen by dr who explained to the patient and his family what would be the plan he agreed to it and he was taken on to the or for removal of a traction pin and open reduction of the left posterior acetabular fracture and closure of left leg fasciotomies, id of left leg soft tissue injury and placement of a vac dsd. he was transfered to pacu stable. in the pacu he was hypotensive and required vassopressors. he was transfered to the tramua sicu for 24 hrs and then to the cc6 floor after being weaned off pressors. dr spoke with the family again about the need to do another vac change prior to plastic surgery doing a flap closure on he

open areas on his left foot. post-operatively, he was transferred to the plastic surgery sergice. patient was placed on stirct bed rest and had the vac in place until post op day 5 ( ). in the interim, the plastics team eventually weaned him off the iv pains medications to regular po pills. he appears to be well controlled on oxycontin 30bid and dialudid po for breakthrough. his foley was did on morning of the 11th and his donor skin graft site was kept open to air. his vac was removed on post-op day 5, which revealed that the foot had taken to the multiple skin graft sites. the thought was to place the patient in a afo splint with orthos approval and prior to discharge to rehab. however, the patient failed to tolerate splint as the current pins in his left foot limited his flexion. after discussion with ortho, they recommended discharge with his foot as is with range of motion as tolerated. they intend to take the pins out of his left foot when he returns for a follow-up appointment a week after discharge. they are aware of the patients foot being in plantar flexion and will work on placing patient in splint after pins are removed. the patient was tolerating

continued mental status changes. evaluate for interval change. technique: serial axial ct images were obtained from the skull base to the vertex without intravenous contrast. findings: compared to the prior study of , there has been no significant interval change in a large left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with area of associated edema. there is no evidence of midline shift or hydrocephalus. a small left subdural hematoma is again identified, unchanged. there is stable subarachnoid hemorrhage. no new areas of acute hemorrhage are identified. previously seen bilateral scalp hematomas are unchanged. opacification of the maxillary and paranasal sinuses are again identified. the osseous structures and multiple fractures are unchanged. impression: stable appearance of the brain with no new areas of hemorrhage or mass effect. the study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. dr. dr. . , : radiology detail - ccc record final report indications: intraparenchymal hemorrhage. assess for carotid traumatic injury. note, this study was initially interpreted on , but is being dictated on the 17th now that multiplanar reformatted images have become available. technique: volumetric ct imaging of the head was performed before and following the administration of 100 cc of optiray contrast, per cta protocol. multiplanar reconstructions were made. comparison: head ct from . ct of the head without and with iv contrast: the area of parenchymal hemorrhage in the left anterior temporal lobe is slightly larger. there is a questionable tiny right frontal subdural hematoma, and questionable parafalcine hematoma posteriorly, which is not significantly changed since the previous study. new subarachnoid blood is seen over multiple sulci and in the interpeduncular fossa. possible evolving frontal contusions are present. at this time, there is no shift of normally midline structures. -white matter differentiation remains preserved. there is no hydrocephalus, and basal cisterns are not effaced. there is no evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage. carotid ct angiography: evaluation of the proximal right common carotid artery is limited due to extensive beam hardening artifact from dense contrast within the right subclavian vein. the more distal right common, external and internal carotid artery are widely patent. atherosclerotic plaque is present in both carotid bulbs, much more so on the right than on the left. both vertebral arteries are patent. there is no evidence of cervical carotid or vertebral dissection. both petrous carotid segments and portions of the carotid arteries within the carotid canal are unremarkable. supraclinoid internal carotid arteries are normal. the middle cerebral arteries and anterior cerebral arteries are unremarkable. the anterior communicating artery is visualized and is normal in caliber. both posterior communicating arteries are probably visualized. the right posterior communicating artery is larger than the left. both posterior cerebral arteries are normal in course and caliber. there is near complete opacification of the sphenoid sinus and a large fluid level within the right maxillary sinus and a right scalp hematoma as described on prior studies. impression: 1. increasing amount of left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage. increasing amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage. no hydrocephalus or ventricular effacement. basal cisterns remain patent. no shift of normally midline structures. 2. no evidence of traumatic injury to the internal carotid arteries. no aneurysm visualized. results were discussed with dr. at 6:45 a.m. on , . the study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. dr. dr. , : radiology detail - ccc record final report indication: mva. comparison: none. technique: axial mdct images were obtained through cervical spine without intravenous contrast. additional coronal and sagittal reformations are provided. contrast: no contrast was administered. ct of the cervical spine without intravenous contrast: the cervical spine is imaged from c1 through t2. no definite fractures are identified within the cervical spine. a questionable lucency within the right transverse process of c6 likely relates to degenerative change or artifact as no definite correlative abnormalities are identified on the sagittal and coronal reformations. there is grade i retrolisthesis of c3 on c4. there is multilevel degenerative change of the cervical spine, with loss of intervertebral disc space height and anterior and posterior osteophytosis, most prominent at c5-6 and c6-7. the visualized outlines of the thecal sac appear unremarkable. ct is limited in its ability to provide intrathecal detail. the prevertebral soft tissues appear unremarkable and endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in place. again seen are fractures of the right temporal bone and right sphenoid with questionable extension to the right carotid canal, as demonstrated on the ct of the head of same date. there is blood within the sphenoid and right maxillary sinuses as well as within the ethmoid air cells. impression: 1. no definite fracture of the cervical spine. 2. fracture of the right temporal and sphenoid bones with possible extension to the right carotid canal. these findings were discussed with the trauma team caring for the patient at the time of interpretation (9:25 p.m.). 3. grade i retrolisthesis of c3 on c4, finding that could relate to degenerative change, although mr of cervical spine is recommended for further evaluation of ligamentous structures if clinically indicated. the study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. dr. r.m. sun dr. , : radiology detail - ccc record final report indication: status post mvc. evaluate for injury. comparison: none. technique: axial mdct images were obtained from the lung apices to the pubic symphysis following the administration of 150 cc of intravenous optiray. additional coronal and sagittal reformations are provided. contrast: intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid rate of bolus injection required for this examination. ct of the chest with intravenous contrast: an endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in place. there is a small amount of fluid within the trachea superior to the endotracheal tube cuff. there is no mediastinal hematoma. the aorta is normal in caliber and contour. there is no pathologic-appearing mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. the heart and pericardium appear unremarkable. two 2 mm nodular opacities are seen within the left lower lobe. there are minimally displaced fractures of the right third, fourth, and fifth ribs. ct of the abdomen with intravenous contrast: within segment vi of the liver, there is a wedge-shaped peripheral hypodensity that extends to the hepatic capsule. there are two additional rounded and oblong hypodensities within segment vii, the larger of which measures 11.2 x 2.1 cm. these are nonspecific in appearance and could represent hypodense hepatic lesions versus focal hepatic contusions. there is no evidence of perihepatic hematoma or fluid collection. the gallbladder is nondistended and contains calcified gallstones. the spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable. there are symmetric nephrograms bilaterally without evidence of perinephric hematoma. tiny, rounded, hypodense lesions are seen within the upper pole of the right kidney and within the upper and lower poles of the left kidney. two additional simple cysts are seen within the interpolar region and lower pole of the left kidney. the aorta is normal in caliber throughout with mural calcifications consistent with atheromatous disease. the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery appear patent proximally. there is no free intraperitoneal air. the large and small bowel loops are normal in caliber. there is diverticulosis of the colon. ct of the pelvis with intravenous contrast: the bladder contains a foley catheter. the prostate and seminal vesicles, rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable. there is no pathologic-appearing pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. bone windows: bone windows demonstrate nondisplaced fractures of 3 right- sided ribs. no other fractures are identified. multiplanar reformats: coronal and sagittal reformations demonstrate three hypodense regions within the right lobe of the liver, within segments vi and vii. the right-sided rib fractures are well delineated on the sagittal reformations. no fractures are appreciated elsewhere within the osseous structures, with no obvious displaced fractures of the thoracic or lumbar spine. impression: 1. three focal hypodensities within segments vi and vii of the liver, including a peripherally based hypodensity within segment vi that may represent hepatic contusion versus hypodense hepatic lesions. no perihepatic hematoma is identified. 2. no other evidence of solid organ injury or free air or free fluid within the abdomen. 3. three right-sided rib fractures and questionable mild right upper lobe pulmonary contusion. 4. two simple cysts within the left kidney and additional tiny, rounded, hypodense lesions, which are too small to accurately characterize. 5. results discussed with the trauma team at the time of interpretation (9:45 p.m.).

arteriogram of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained with and without iv contrast. no prior ct scan of the abdomen or pelvis is available. correlation is made with a chest ct dated . ct abdomen with iv contrast: there are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with bibasilar atelectasis. a small pneumothorax is seen on the left, with a chest tube in place. lung bases demonstrate emphysematous changes, as well as suggestion of bronchiectasis. within a right lower lobe bronchus, a 3 mm focus of debris is noted, possibly representing aspirated mucus, though could be followed on future examinations. liver, gallbladder, adrenals, kidneys, spleen and pancreas appear grossly unremarkable. abdominal aorta is normal in size and caliber, without evidence of aneurysmal dilatation. the abdominal aorta measures up to 2.2 cm in maximal axial dimension. renal arteries are widely patent, with note made of an accessory renal artery on the left. superior mesenteric artery, celiac artery and inferior mesenteric artery are widely patent. the iliac arteries are normal. ct pelvis with iv contrast: the urinary bladder contains a foley catheter. prostate and seminal vesicles appear grossly normal. there is a segment of circumferential thickening involving the sigmoid colon, covering an approximately 5 cm length of the colon. the wall is thickened, measuring up to 1.6 cm. extensive diverticuli are seen within the sigmoid colon. dense linear tracts within the lateral wall of the sigmoid colon near the areas of maximal thickness may represent sinus tracts. there is trace inflammatory change surrounding the areas of wall thickening. though multiple lymph nodes are seen within the left lower quadrant mesentery, none are greater than approximately 5 mm. no free fluid. bone windows: no suspicious bony lesions. bone islands are noted within the left iliac bone, of no significance. degenerative changes are noted within the spine. impression: 1. no evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm. 2. circumferential thickening within the sigmoid colon, with suggestion of intramural sinus tracts. differential considerations include colon carcinoma or acute diverticulitis. further workup, such as colonoscopy, is advised. . . cxr portable: chest (portable ap) reason: for ptx medical condition: 57m copd sp extubation, ct removal . reason for this

windows. there are no prior studies for comparison. findings: there is no intracranial hemorrhage. the -white matter differentiation is well maintained. there is no mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. there is a likely small cyst within the hippocampal region of the left temporal posteriorly. this diagnosis could be best confirmed via mri. osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. impression: no acute intracranial abnormality visualized. brief hospital course: ap: 57 m copd admitted to osh with h flu pna cb nstemi(peak trop i 2.52), and large left ptx now sp left chest tube placement transferred to for difficulties oxygenating. -osh course ( ): pt was admitted to osh on with hypoxia, cough, leukocystosis wbandemia and hypotension. he was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. imaging revealed sinusitis, infiltrate suspicisou for pna vs. atelectasis and spiculated lul nodule. micro data resulted in postivie h.flu in sputum. treatment was initiated with antibiotics (ctx, levoquin) for pna, and steroids for copd flare. pt ruled in for nstemi, however due to hemodynamic instability, pt did not receive cardiac catheterization. pt aspirated tube feeds (found in ett) and pna coverage expanded to flagyl. respiratory status showed improving acidemia, worsening hypercarbia and worsening hypoxia prompting a chest ct which showed left lung collapse without midline shift. a chest tube was placed urgently by ct surgery for a pneumothorax and the pt was transferred to . - micu course ( ): pt was admitted directly to micu on dopamine where he was found to be febrile to 101.2, hypotensive to sbp of 70s. pt was swithced to levophed and started on ceftazidime, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl. the patient was initially started on must protocol for presumed sepsis. he finished his course of antibiotics on , pressors were weaned off, pneumothorax resolved, chest tube was removed on and extubated successfully on . the patient was placed on asa and statin for her nstemi, however b-blockers and ace inhibitors were held due to hypotension. pt also received ct demonstrating colonic thickening. once extubated successfully and stable from respiratory standpoint, the patient was transferred to the floor. - micu course ( ): patient was found to have coffee-ground emesismelena and hypotension and was therefore re-transferred to unit following several boluses of fluid to maintain perfusion pressure. there, patient underwent egd, which revealed only non-bleeding erosions of stomach and duodenum. h pylori serology was negative. however, patient was found to be bacteremic with mrsa and was treated with vancomycin iv 1.75g q12hours to attain a therapeutic trough level. due to active bacteremia, patient also underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed no evidence of endocarditis. following clearing of cultures and stabilization of blood pressure, patient was called-out to floor and a picc placed. 1. pulmonary: pt originally seen at osh with sob, cough, wbc and found to be hypotensive, hypoxic and hypercarbic. pt was intubated at osh for respiratory distress complicated by pneumothorax and was transferred to for difficult oxygenation. at osh, cta neg for pe but positive for infiltrate suggestive of pna vs. atelectasis in addition to a spiculated lung mass in lul. at , pt finished course of abx and pneumothorax resolved with chest tube. pt was successfully extubated, and chest tube removed without complication following resolution of air leak. a). pna: pt tested positive for h.flu at osh and received ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. coverage was expanded at osh after aspiration event. coverage was expanded to vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl and ceftaz at . bal on positive for mrsa. pt finished 14 day course of antibiotics and had minimal sputum following completion of course. b). hypoxichypercarbic respiratory failure. this was felt to be secondary to h flu pneumonia as above. pt was transferred to intubated. he was successfully extubated on , without further complications. c). copd: given patients emphysematous bullae on radiographic studies, it was felt that pneumothorax was most likely secondary to positive pressure ventilation in the presence of chronic emphysema. patient was managed with stress dose steroids and nebs as needed without acute issues, and had no evidence of respiratory distress resulting from obstructive physiology. d). ptx: patient had chest tube placed at outside hospital with successful reduction in size of pneumothorax from 75%-20% of lung and did not have any evidence of tension pneumothorax despite question of difficulty oxygenating. over the course of hospitalization, left apical pneumothorax continued to improve significantly. nonetheless, patient had persistent air leak through hospital day 9. on hospital day 11, however, patient underwent a water seal trial with continued resolution of pneumothorax. therefore, on hospital day 13, patient had chest tube removed successfully. however, it was noted at the time of removal that patient still had persistent leak of air from thoracic cavity from the chest tube site, and sutures were placed at the chest tube site to aid in closure. e). lung mass: ct surgery following. believes mass is malignant appearing and concerning for primary lung ca. requesting outpatient pet scan, pft and cardiac work up as well as a follow up appointment for possible vatsminimally invasive lobectomy. to followup with (office: ). 2. nstemi: pt with reported nstemi on transfer from osh, however given clinical history, most likely due to demand ischemia. indeed, patient had upper gi bleed while on heparin, and therefore no further anticoagulation was administered. furthermore, given initial hypotension, beta blockade was held, and patient was only given aspirin and statin for treatment of coronary artery disease. patient to followup with cardiology following stabilization of critical care issues. 3. ugibanemia: pt with hx of esophageal varices and ugib, had coffee grounds on . pt was seen by gi, who recommended conservative therapy with ppi , avoid nsaids, and transfusion as necessary. pt did not receive an egd or colonoscopy. ---hct on admit was 38. has since trended down to mid-30 range and now on transfer to floor was 28.7. ---goal hct 30 given pts history of nstemi. pt was transfused 2units of prbcs ---cont ppi and avoid nsaids. ---consider re-consulting gi. however given acuity of pts recent nstemi, risk of bowel prep and colonoscopy may outweight the benefit. ultimately patient to go for colonoscopy as outpatient especially given below. 4. sigmoid thickening: incidental finding by abd ct on . divertics vs colon cancer. given pts spiculated lung mass very concerning for ca. further work-up advised, colonoscopy as outpatient. 5. afib: pt had episode of rapid afib on , which was treated with iv lopressor, unsuccessfully and ultimately requiring diltiazem gtt to return to sinus bradycardia. 6. hypotension: pt was hypotensive on admission and started on da gtt which was switched to levophed. pt weaned off dopamine but still unable to be started on bb and acei due to hypotension. ---observe for 4 hours and if stable will start bb andor acei as tolerated. 7. alcohol withdrawal: on transfer, patient required benzodiazepine gtt for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and it was noted that patient became intermittently tachycardic (while still intubated) when versed gtt was tapered. likewise, patient became tachycardic when fentanyl was tapered, and as such both sedative medications were successfully tapered slowly over micu course. 8. mental status: pt was sedated with versed gtt and ativan gtt while intubated. pt with episode of disorientation and dyspnea post extubation. after removal of pain meds and bzd, dyspnea resolved, however pt remained disoriented. suspect most likely due to above alcoholbdz withdrawal. 9. weakness: pt with moderate amounts of weakness since transfer from icu. however it is slightly concerning that the weakness is more pronounced on the right than the left. as the pt suffered an nstemi during his hospitalization at the osh prior to intubation, but no radiographic evidence of stroke. patient to follow up with neuromuscular specialist re: weakness. 10. dvt: pt with dvt at osh but bilat lower extremity us neg for above-the-knee deep venous thrombosis. furthermore, given history of gi bleed on anticoagulation, it was felt that risk did not outweigh benefit, and patient was kept on subcutaneous heparin only. . full code medications on

also depressed at 17. his sternum was stable. his incisions were clean, dry, and intact. his abdomen was mildly distended. the patient continued to be confused. he was started back on his amiodarone, plavix, and aspirin as his dobutamine was weaned. he was seen by case management. he had some postoperative atrial fibrillation with some broad complex tachycardia that paroxysmal and then converted back to a narrow complex in atrial fibrillation, with a ventricular rate of about 90 to 100. he was already on intravenous amiodarone. on postoperative day three, he had a decreased cardiac index, so his dobutamine was increased. he also started levaquin for his pulmonary status. he was awake. his lungs had coarse breath sounds. his incisions were otherwise clean, dry, and intact. he remained

small subarachnoid hemorrhagic component in the left parietal sulci. 3. ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter in place. echo: the left atrium is elongated. no atrial septal defect is seen by 2d or color doppler. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (lvef55%). regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. tissue doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (pcwp18mmhg). there is no ventricular septal defect. right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. there is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. no aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is no

dilt 10mg iv with drop in hr to 90s but also drop in sbp to 90s. stat head ct at that time showed increase size in the sdh. skull films were taken to evaluate her vp shunt. she was transferred to the micu. . in the micu the patient was tranfused 3 units prbcs. repeat head ct showed a stable sdh since . she had an ivc filter placed on for pe prophylaxis. induced sputum was negative x1 for afb; the patient was unable to provide further sputum samples. ms , however, r sided weakness and facial droop resolved. a uti was diagnosed on and treatment was instituted with ciprofloxacin. sensitivities returned on and antibiotics were changed to bactrim as the e coli infection was resistant to cipro. she was called out to the floor on . . on the floor, the following issues were addressed: . uti- the patient was found to have a uti. she was initially treated with cipro, however, culture revealed growth of e coli, resistant to cipro but sensitive to bactrim. therefore, her antibiotics were changed to bactrim. she was treated with bactrim ds from . a repeat ua was wnl. her mental status markedly improved with treatment of her uti. . ms changesdelerium- the patient was delerious through much of her hospitalization. this was thought to be toxic metabolic in the setting of infection, icu setting, sdh and hip fracture. she required prn haldoperidol and restraints for safety while in the icu, these measures were discontinued by the time of her transfer to the floor. her mental status markedly improved with treatment of above, and returned to near her baseline per her family members at the time of discharge, though she still had some mild waxing and (especially in the early mornings). her home psychiatrist, dr , was contact and updated throughout her stay. her remeron dose was decreased per dr suggestion from 7.5 mg qhs to 3.75 mg qhs. sdh- presented with small bl sdh on , found to have increased sdh on . treated with dilantin for seizure prophylaxis x 1 week after enlargement. eeg

with history of paf. she initially had an episode of afib with rvr in the setting of hct drop from 30 to 20 ( ), but this resolved after resuscitation with blood products. received total of 3 u prbcs. from until the patient had several episodes of sustained rvr to the 140s (without symptoms, change in bp or ekg changes). diltiazem was started and titrated up; a beta blocker was also added with good control. tsh was normal. she was not anticoagulated given her recent sdh. we did not do a cta to assess for pe as underlying etiology of recurrent afib as it would not change management (no anticoagulation in setting of sdh). at the time of discharge her rate was well controlled in the 80s x 24hours, with 1-2 brief and self limited episodes of rates of 120. in general, the frequency of rvr, duration of episodes and amplitude of hr were markedly improved. given the limitations of her bp we were not able to further uptitrate her nodal agents. the patient was asymptomatic, hd stable throughout these bursts of tachycardia without any adverse events such as ekg changes, hypotension or cp. given the size of her la, it is unlikely she would stay in sinus rhythm; she is not currently a candidate for anticoagulation. she will follow up with her pcp for possible further uptitration of her betablocker after discharge. . hip fx: an orif was performed on . ortho followed the patient throughout her stay. an ivc filter was placed for dvt ppx as the patient was not a candidate for anticoagulation given her sdh. physical therapy was started. she will require extensive pt at discharge. staples were removed . she will follow up with ortho in weeks. . pleuroparenchymal scarringtraction bronchiectasis at bilateral apices: pt was aasymptomatic throughout her course. there is a question of tb infection in the past. ppd negative this admission. unlikely but possible etiologies include tb, mac, fungal infection or malignancy. an attempt was made to rule her out for tb, but given lack of cough and sputum production, we could not obtain adequate specimens. she did have one induced sputum which was negative for afb. as the patient has no cough, no hymoptysis, no night sweats and a repeat cxr showed only mild volume overload, tb precautions were discontinued and the workup was halted based on low clinical suspicion of active disease. an outpatient workup may be considered if respiratory symptoms develop. . hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, osteoporosis: the patient was continued on lipitor, hctz, and calciumvitamin d. alendronate was restarted at

date: discharge date: date of birth: sex: m service: trauma surgery history of present illness: this 32 year-old male unrestrained passenger of a pick-up was involved in a motor vehicle collision, which involved driving off the road and down an embankment. the patient was found in the drivers seat hanging upside down with his legs suspended about his neck. he was awake upon arrival to an outside hospital, however, he was subjective to a prolonged extraction time in the field. at the outside hospital the patient was intubated and a left chest tube was placed. past medical history: unknown. allergies: unknown. medications: unknown on admission. social history: unknown at the time of admission. physical examination: the patients vital signs were temperature 96.9, heart rate 120, 12874, 18 respiratory rate and sating 100%. the patient was intubated and sedated with a hard cervical collar in place. lung examination was significant for coarse breath sounds bilaterally. the heart was regular rate and rhythm. the abdomen was soft and nontender and nondistended and the extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis or edema. the patient had normal rectal tone per examination and the patient was guaiac negative. admission laboratories: hematocrit of 42.4, white count of 25.0, platelet count of 207. electrolytes drawn at the time were within normal limits. a ct scan of the thoracic spine revealed a t9 and t10 compression fracture as well as a fracture of the spinous process at t9. a t12 transverse process fracture and mild canal narrowing at the levels of t11 and t12. at the time of admission the orthopedic spine service was consulted and their recommendation was for reexamination following lightening of sedation for a full neurological examination. pending the patients intubated and sedated status they recommended maintenance with a log roll precautions at all times. after initial workup in the trauma bay the patient was transferred to the trauma intensive care unit where repeat laboratories were significant for a hematocrit of 33, white blood cell count of 16.3 and a platelet count of 161. in addition to the plan outlined by the orthopedics spine consult the trauma intensive care unit team pursued a bronchoscopy for diminished right upper lobe breath sounds as well as a left shoulder plain film to assess for acute trauma. additional radiological workup was significant for a left pneumothorax being treated with a left chest tube and multiple left rib fractures. head ct, abdominal ct and diagnostic peritoneal lavage were all negative. upon repeat chest x-ray the patient was found to also have a right pleural effusion and this was treated on hospital day two with a placement of a right chest tube. the output from this chest tube was immediately 50 cc of sanguinous fluid and after the tube was placed to suction an additional 20 cc of sanguinous fluid was drawn from the chest tube. on follow up consultation orthopedics recommended a brace for treatment of the patients compression fractures and other spinal fractures. this brace was fitted to the patient on hospital day two, . on hospital day three the patient continued to be intubated and sedated. on examination his heart was regular, but he continued to have coarse breath sounds bilaterally. the plan per the intensive care unit team was to wean to extubation and to hold sedation after fitting of the tlso brace. the patient was also placed on a ciwa protocol, benzodiazepines for treatment of his incipient alcohol withdraw. on cultures were returned on the patients bronchoalveolar lavage, which was performed on . these tests were positive for methacillin resistant staph aureus and the patient was placed on vancomycin. on the neurology service was consulted to evaluate the patients mental status, which had still not returned to baseline despite the weaning of sedation. their assessment was that this otherwise healthy 32 year-old male had an altered mentals status probably due to the factor of medications subsequent to high doses of benzodiazepines and morphine. increased right leg weakness and decreased sensation to the right lower extremity were attributed to his known thoracic spine fractures. to further workup these neurological deficits the neurology service recommended an mri of the full spinal cord to evaluate for nerve root or spinal cord injury. they also recommended a speech and swallow evaluation for this patient as well as weaning of all sedation to allow this patients mental status to normalize. these recommendations were followed by the trauma intensive care unit team. on the patient had blood cultures and urine cultures drawn pursuant to recommendations by the neurology service for a workup of his recurrent fevers. in addition, electroencephalogram was performed as well as a mri of the brain with diffusion weighted imaging was ordered to evaluate the patient for diffuse axonal injury. final read on the mri of the spinal canal was obtained on and this showed cord compression and fracture collapse and worsening fracture. given these findings the orthopedic service assessment was that the brace was not adequate treatment and a full body tlso brace was fitted. to provide stabilization for this patients spinal fractures, the patient was taken to the operating room by orthopedics on for posterior stabilization of his compression fracture. the patient underwent a t7 through t12 laminectomy and fusion done by the orthopedic spine service on . this procedure was completed without complications. postoperatively, the patient initially showed minimal movement of his right arm and left leg to pain, however, these initial neurological changes on examination resolved subsequently and were not suggestive of intraoperative cord trauma. on postoperative day two the patient was intubated and sedated and continued to have low grade fevers with a t max of 101.5. he was moving all extremities spontaneously and able to squeeze the examiners fingers on command. as treatment for the low grade fevers and in light of the patients former positive cultures for mrsa, the patient was continued on vancomycin and levaquin. on the patient was fitted with a clam shell brace, which he was to wear when elevated greater then 30 degrees in bed or at any time when he was sitting in a chair or otherwise at his bed. on hospital day thirteen postoperative day four the patient was transferred to the standard nursing floor where he pulled out his feeding tube, but was otherwise alert and oriented to person and place. his examination was stable including his neurological examination and a speech and swallow examination was scheduled to evaluate the patient for initiating oral intake. as far as his mental status the patient continued to be confused and was talking repeatedly and perseverating over topics especially involving his former occupation as a food delivery person. on a bedside swallow evaluation was performed with recommendations to continue the patient npo with an nasogastric tube and to obtain a video swallow study to rule out aspiration. this was pursuant to observations by the bedside swallow evaluator of overt speech and swallow aspiration on large straw sips of water. this video swallow study was performed later on and the results of the study were moderate to severe oropharyngeal dysphagia were observed by piece meal bolus handling. reduced anterior posterior tongue movement as well as premature spillage into the pharynx, mild oral residue and increased oral transit time were noted. consistent with these findings the patient was recommended to remain npo and continue to obtain his nutrition via feeding tube. on hospital day sixteen postoperative day seven the patient continued to be in stable condition and was afebrile. his mental status was attributed to a likely diffuse axonal injury given his quite severe roll over motor vehicle accident. an ent consult was obtained to evaluate the patient for continued hoarseness. the ent service evaluated the patient on and recommended humidified air by shovel mask, reflux precautions as well as the reverse trendelenburg positioning pursuant to their assessment of erythema or retinoid and vocal cords. using fiberoptic laryngoscopy both vocal cords were mobile and the airway was visualized and patent. on the patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service whose impression was that the patient would require a long period of bed rest. rehabilitation was considered appropriate for this patient given his altered mental status as well as his significant rehabilitation requirements. occupational therapy also assessed this patient on and their treatment plan included assistance with activities of daily living, subsequent to the patients impairment including his fitting with tlso brace as well as his altered mental status. in addition, pursuant to these recommendations the patient was screened by a case manager for placement in appropriate neurological rehabilitation hospital. however, the patient lacked appropriate insurance, placement was a recurring issue throughout the remainder of his hospital stay. on hospital day nineteen, postoperative day ten the patient continued to be in stable condition and was continuing his vancomycin for a positive culture for mrsa. his mental status slowly improving, however, the patient continued to perseverate over work related subjects. on hospital day 21 postoperative day eleven, the patient was taken to the operating room with orthopedics for incision and drainage of his back wound, which was concerning for infection. this procedure was performed without complications and intraoperative cultures were sent. the wound edges were reposed using staples and a drain was placed. on postoperative day two following this procedure the drain was pulled for minimal output and the wound was noted to be healing appropriately. intraoperative cultures were positive for methacillin resistant staph aureus and vancomycin was again initiated. neurologically the patient continued to improve as far as

of intervertebral disc space, upper lumbar spine. clinical correlation is recommended. . echo: conclusions: the left atrium is mildly dilated. no atrial septal defect is seen by 2d or color doppler. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (lvef55%). regional left ventricular wall motion appears normal (in some views the inferior wall appears hypokinetic but this may be due to frequent ectopyirregular rhythm). right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the aortic root is mildly dilated. the ascending aorta is mildly dilated. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. no masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. trace aortic regurgitation is seen. the left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. transmitral doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with grade i (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. no vegetationmass is seen on the pulmonic valve. there is no pericardial effusion. impression: no valvular vegetations seen. . mr l spine : findings: no comparisons are available. . there is large area of destruction involving the l12 disc with destructive end plate changes of l1 and l2. there is heterogeneously increased t2 signal as well as diffuse enhancement of these vertebral bodies and disc, consistent with spondylitic discitis. there is paraspinal and epidural phlegmon without a discrete abscess. at t12l1, there is a left lateral disc bulge extending from the foramen to the extraforaminal region. there is no significant central canal or neural foraminal narrowing at this level. note is made of a 1 cm gallstone. impression: l12 spondylodiscitis with paraspinal and epidural phlegmon without a discrete abscess. the epidural phlegmon is causing 25-50% central canal narrowing . left venous upper extremity ultrasound: impression: intraluminal thrombus within the left ij vein. the remainder of the right upper extremity veins are patent. there is a small soft tissue fluid collection adjacent to the left shoulder, which may represent a small post-procedure hematoma . ct chest : impression: 1. osseous destruction at l1-2 with paravertebral soft tissue consistent with osteomyelitisdiscitis, better demonstrated on recent mr . evaluation of the central canal is limited on ct. 2. bilateral pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusions, likely representing pulmonary edema, although superimposed pneumonia is not excluded. 3. no evidence of intra-abdominal abscess. 4. gallstones, without evidence of cholecystitis. 5. absent bilateral native kidneys and atrophic-appearing transplant kidney, right pelvis. . cxr : there has been a substantial increase in perihilar pulmonary consolidation which is seen on the lateral view to lie in the upper and middle lobes, less so in the lower. in addition, there are discretely nodular opacities seen in the lower lungs particularly on the right, all of which points to disseminated infection, alternatively progressive pulmonary hemorrhage, rather than pulmonary edema as suggested previously. mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable and there is no appreciable pleural effusion. there has been interval increase in thickness of the right paratracheal and mediastinal soft tissue probably combination of azygos vein distention, mediastinal fat deposition, and some increase in central adenopathy. left supraclavicular dual-channel dialysis catheter has been advanced to the lower third of the svc. there is no pneumothorax . ct chest: impression: worsening multilobar pneumonia, much less likely pulmonary hemorrhage. . bone scan: impression: 1. abnormal focal osseous uptake along the right aspect of the l1 and l2 vertebral bodies which may represent osteomyelitis, though non-specific. this will be correlated to the results of the white blood cell scan when available. 2. marked diffuse cardiac uptake, which could be consistent cardiac amyloidosis. . wbc scan: impression: 1. pneumonia 2. no convincing evidence for spinal osteomyelitis although in-111 white blood cells may have some decrease in sensitiviy in the spine. . mr of right shoulder: impression: 1. extremely limited examination. the patient could not complete the study and the submitted images are degraded by significant motion artifact. there is a loculated high t2 signal collection anterior to the scapula extending anterior to the shoulder. several round low signal lesions are present in this collection. findings are nonspecific but most likely represent severe glenohumeral degenerative changes with an effusion containing degenerative loose bodies. further evaluation could be made with either a dedicated ct through the shoulder or if the patient clinically stabilizes, an attempt at a repeat mr with more time sensitive sequences. correlation with plain x- rays is suggested. 2. bilateral upper lobe lung consolidations . admission labs: 03:30pm wbc-10.2 rbc-3.73 hgb-10.1 hct-32.8 mcv-88 mch-27.1 mchc-30.8 rdw-18.5 10:30pm glucose-178 urea n-28 creat-3.3 sodium-138 potassium-4.2 chloride-98 total co2-25 anion gap-19 10:30pm calcium-8.4 phosphate-4.3 magnesium-1.5 brief hospital course: 59 year old male with history of esrd alports syndrome who presented initially with k of 7.7 and ekg changes, and now is with fever of unknown origin. . 1) fever of unknown origindiscitisosteomyelitispneumonia: the patient presented with high fever spikes. patient had recently finished a three week course of vancomycin from presumed bacteremia from av fistula, but per , all blood cultures sent were negative. during that hospital course at he had a temporary hd catheter placed. on admission, it was thought initially that the patient had a hd catheter infection. the patient was maintained on vancomycin had his catheter replaced and the tip sent for culture. during hospital course, the patient continued to have fever spikes. all blood cultures and catheter tip culture returned negativeno growth to date. therefore infectious disease was consulted regarding fever of unknown origin. infectious disease, recommended removal of hd catheter x 48 hours (after it was already changed on admission, given continued fever spikes), but patient refused. . patient also had a known history of discitis and osteomyelitis of l1-l2epidural abscess in . after evaluation at he was evaluated for this problem again at in . he has had ct guided biopsies of this area in the past, from which the cultures have been negative. a new mr of spine was obtained during his hospital course that demonstrated continued l12 spondylodiscitis with paraspinal and epidural phlegmon without a discrete abscess. another ct guided biopsy was considered, and therefore the orthopedic spine team was consulted. they felt once all other infectious etiologies were ruled out, we could consider an incision and drainage of the phlegmon andor a debridement. . other infectious work up during hospital course included a trans-thoracic echocardiogram which was negative for valvular vegetations, ultrasound of chest wall (where hd catheter was) which was negative for absess, ultrasound of left upper extremity deep veins that demonstrated dvt in left ij, initial ct thorax that did not demonstrate any absesses, but revealed bilateral pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusions, which likely represent fluid overload (although are considering other etiologies on differential), bone scan, wbc scan (revealing pneumonia), bronchoscopy, and an mr of the shoulder (possible effusion noted). . a repeat cxr was performed later in his course, which raised the possibility of disseminated infection or septic emboli. this led to a pulmonary consult, and per their suggestions, we rechecked his chest ct after dialysis, sent sputum samples and sent out an anti-gbm antibody. later in his course, the ct of the chest and the white cell scan revealed a multilobar pneumonia, so a bronchoscopy was performed. as the patients fever curve worsened, while waiting for bronchoscopy results, he was empirically started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl. with these antibiotics on board, the patient had an episode of hypotension. this, with his fever and tachycardia was worrisome for sepsis, so he was transferred to the icu for fluid resuscitation. . initially per infectious disease, patient was maintained on vancomycin, but was not broadened as to not mask etiology of infection. later in his course all antibiotics were stopped such that the patients fever curve and cultures could be followed off antibiotics. eventually with a source of pneumonia, and the patient having increased fevers, it was decided the patient needed to be covered and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics while cultures were pending. . 2) atrial fibrillation: in the icu, the patient converted into atrial fibrillation with a rate of 140-150 following hemodialysis. the patient denies atrial fibrillation in the past, but this could be related to the stress of infection. in the icu, he was started on metoprolol, and converted back to normal sinus rhythm. the patient remained on telemetry, and was only noted to have ventricular bigeminy. he was maintained on metoprolol throughout hospital course. initially, anticoagulation was held due to possible coumadin allergy. then patient was noted to not have this allergy, and started on heparin. deferred initiation of coumadin to outpatient setting (as patient was only in atrial fibrillation for short time period). the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout remainder of hospital course. . 3) hyperkalemia: his hyperkalemia resolved status post dialysis, kayexylate, calciumbicarb and insulin. his ekg improved post-intervention and we continued to monitor for re-occurrance. his hyperkalemia on admission was attributed to the fact that he had recently missed dialysis and that his dialysis catheter was not functioning properly. patients potassium level remained stable throughout remainder of hospital course. . 4) left internal jugular vein clot: the patient was noted to have a clot of left internal jugular vein on ultrasound. there was a questionable allergy to coumadin noted in the chart, so while this was being confirmed, anticoagulation was postponed. we felt that the patients allergy to coumadin was unlikely (after further investigation) and therefore started a heparin drip. he should start coumadin as well in the future prior to hospital discharge. he will likely need only 1 month of anticoagulation for left ij dvt. . 5) esrd: patient was continued on hemodialysis, three days per week (mwf) and was followed by nephrology. he did well with nephrocaps, renal diet, and hemodialysis. . 6) hypertension: patients blood pressures remained controlled on metoprolol, and the dose was adjusted for optimal control. we did not restart hydralazine as the patients blood pressures were normal, and we were unsure if this was needed (he is on hydralazine and not isosorbide at home, so less renal benefits). . 7) adrenal insufficiency: we continued his prednisone, and he did not require any stress doses. . 8) hypothyroidism: we continued his home dose of levoxyl. based on the thyroid studies, he can go up on his dose, but he is clinically euthyroid so this can be adjusted as an outpatient. . 9) diabetes: we continued to increase his sliding scale insulin, until he maintained good blood glucose control. micu course : pt arrived to the micu with a bp in the 80s-90s. he refused central line placement, so his hd catheter was used for central access. he received a one liter fluid bolus and his bp remained stable in the 120s for the rest of his micu stay. he was covered with broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc, flagyl, ceftaz -- due to cefepime allergy, and levofloxacin) per id recommendations. his steroids were increased to prednisone 40 mg given hx adrenal insufficiency. he remained afebrile. his cultures remained negative, and he was transferred back to the floor on . on the floor - the medicine team was called to the icu to admit the patient to floor. the patient at that time decided with his family to discontinue further aggressive medical care, and be made comfort measures only. the implications of this desicion were discussed at length, and it was made clear that it woudl likely result in his death. he understood the implications, and despite the slim chance that continued aggressive treatment might have resulted in significantly prolonging his life, he wished to be made comfort measures only. the decision was discussed with his wife, who was supportive. he passed away on the floor shortly after. medications on admission: recently finished course of vanc on metoprolol 100mg mvi zolpidem prn tylenol prn nephrocaps asa 81mg qd nexium 40mg qd lidoderm

date: discharge date: service: cardiac surgery history of the present illness: this is an 81-year-old gentleman with known coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in , treated with streptokinase, status post myocardial infarction in , treated with a stent to the lad in . the patient also has known aortic stenosis followed by serial echocardiograms with an ejection fraction in of 35% with an aortic valve area of 1 cm squared. the patient presented to an outside hospital complaining of ten days of what he describes as his anginal equivalent which is right arm squeezing not relieved by nitroglycerin. at the outside hospital, his workup was initially negative, discharged home and subsequently represented with the same symptoms and at that time did have a small troponin leak. he was transferred to on for further evaluation and transthoracic echocardiogram at that time showed an aortic valve area of 0.7 cm squared. cardiac catheterization showed a patent proximal lad at the site of the prior stent, a 90% first diagonal lesion and 70% focal third diagonal lesion, 70% proximal obstruction of the first obtuse marginal and minimal irregularities in the right coronary artery. the patient and his family elected to be transferred to for operative treatment of his coronary artery disease and his aortic stenosis. past medical history: 1. hypertension. 2. diabetes mellitus, noninsulin-dependent. 3. hypercholesterolemia. 4. gout. 5. peripheral vascular disease. 6. known right iliac artery aneurysm. 7. history of complete heart block, status post permanent pacer

to the and underwent preoperative evaluation for cardiac surgery. he had electrophysiology consult to evaluate his pacemaker which was functioning properly. he underwent a dental evaluation which showed that he had no problems that would put him at risk for cardiac surgery or aortic valve replacement. the patient had an ultrasound of his carotid arteries which showed no significant stenosis. on , the patient was taken to the operating room with dr. . the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm - pericardial valve as well as a cabg times one with svg to om. in the operating room, a transesophageal echocardiogram showed that the patients ejection fraction was 20-25%. the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit on low-dose epinephrine infusion and propofol. total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 132 minutes, cross-clamp time 100 minutes. the patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on his first postoperative evening. the patients hemodynamics as well as his cardiac index remained good. the epinephrine was weaned to off on postoperative day number one with continued good hemodynamics. the patient was started on captopril for afterload reduction. on postoperative day number one, the electrophysiology service interrogated the patients internal pacemaker which showed that it continued to function appropriately after bypass surgery. on postoperative day number two, the patient was noted to have mild thrombocytopenia. heparin dependent antibodies were sent to the laboratory which were subsequently negative. on postoperative day number two, the patient was transferred from the intensive care unit to the regular part of the hospital. the patient began ambulating with physical therapy. the patient had complaints of right scapular and back pain which the patient had previously and this pain responded well to percocet. the patient was started on lasix for diuresis. on postoperative day number three, the patient was noted to have an elevated white blood cell count. all of his incisions looked fine without erythema or drainage. blood, urine, and sputum cultures were sent. the patient was also noted to have a rising creatinine. the patients baseline creatinine was thought to be 1.1 to 1.5. the patients creatinine on postoperative day number three rose to 1.6. the patients captopril was discontinued as this was thought to be the likely source. repeat laboratory studies later on postoperative day number three showed that the patient had a rising potassium up to 5.6. the patient was given one dose of kayexalate and subsequently the patients potassium returned to . also, the laboratory studies on postoperative day number three, the patients white blood cell count which had been 16 had risen to 19 with a left shift. the patients urinalysis showed positive blood, positive protein, small leukocyte esterase, red blood cells, and many bacteria. the patient was started on levofloxacin for a presumed urinary tract infection. on postoperative day number four, the patients repeat liver function tests which on postoperative day number three had been only mildly elevated, had risen significantly with ast that had risen to 1,260 from 264, alt 2,002 from 279. a gi consult was obtained and the patients medications that were thought to be the most likely culprits were discontinued. the patient had his probenecid, pravastatin, his levofloxacin discontinued and because of the patients multiple ongoing issues it was elected to transfer the patient back into the intensive care unit for closer monitoring. as the day progressed on postoperative day number four, the patient began complaining of increasing nausea and right upper quadrant pain. a right upper quadrant ultrasound performed at the bedside showed normal flow within the portal and hepatic veins. the common bile duct was within normal limits without evidence of choledocholithiasis. the gallbladder was found to be absent. the hepatology service felt that the most likely cause of the transaminitis was medication. the patient had liver function tests followed daily after that and they continued to trend down thereafter. the patients inr which had risen to 1.5 to 1.6 proceeded to decrease to 1.3. the patient also had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed which showed an ejection fraction of 15-20%, normal left ventricular wall thickness, mildly dilated left ventricular cavity, normal right ventricular wall thickness, normal right ventricular chamber size, 1 mitral regurgitation, 2 tricuspid regurgitation, a normally functioning aortic bioprosthetic. overall, it was felt to be not significantly changed from preoperatively. the patients urinary tract infection which had initially been treated with levofloxacin was subsequently treated with iv ceftriaxone as levofloxacin was potentially one of the medications that was contributing to the elevated transaminases. the patients creatinine began to decrease and the patients white blood cell count began to decrease as well on the antibiotics. by postoperative day number eight, the patient had stabilized. the acute transaminitis was resolving and the patient was transferred back from the intensive care unit to the regular part of the hospital. on postoperative day number nine, the patient worked with physical therapy and was able to complete a level v which included walking 500 feet and climbing one flight of stairs without difficulty without requiring oxygen and remaining hemodynamically stable. the hepatology service on postoperative day number nine still did not have a clear etiology of the elevated liver function tests; however, they recommended that the patient follow-up with his primary care physician as an outpatient for monitoring of his liver function tests as well as checking , afp, a ferritin, a tibc, and ama. over this period of time, the patient continued to complain of symptoms of reflux. the patient has a history of reflux disease and with his elevated liver function tests, his h2 blocker and proton pump inhibitor were discontinued. the patient was medicated with maalox which had good effect. the patient was started on carafate for stress ulcer prophylaxis. on postoperative day number ten, the patients pacer wires were removed without difficulty. on postoperative day number 11, the patient was noted to have edematous bilateral lower extremities with his right leg greater than his left. his right leg was the site of his saphenous vein harvest; however, the patient complained of significant calf tenderness and cramping when he was walking. it was decided to perform a right lower extremity ultrasound to rule out dvt. this was negative for any clot and the patient was noted to have small bilateral pleural effusions on chest x-ray. the patient was given a dose of iv lasix with prompt response for large amounts of urine output and decrease in the edema in his lower extremities. by perative day number 11, the patient was cleared for discharge to home; however, on his laboratory examination on postoperative day number 11, the patient was noted to have a slightly more elevated white blood cell count of 16.9. the patients white blood cell count had been remaining in the mid teens range. this was elevated from the prior day at 13.8. this was discussed with dr. and dr. examined the patient. the patient had been afebrile, felt well, and had wanted to go home. it was decided that the patient would be pan cultured and would be discharged to home with strict instructions to return to the hospital if he had any evidence of fever or felt unwell and the cultures would be followed for any evidence of infection. the patients urinalysis showed occasional bacteria, no white blood cells, no leukocyte esterase, essentially negative for a urinary tract infection. the patients blood cultures are pending at this point. the patients chest x-ray showed continued small bilateral pleural effusions. therefore, the patient is cleared for discharge to home. condition on discharge: t maximum 97.8, pulse 73,

( , but the number is out of order) decided to reduce her mestinone to . after one week, her niece noticed that she was having more trouble moving without her walker and that her eyes were drooping

there is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. impression: mild pulmonary hypertension with preserved biventricular systolic function. brief hospital course: ms. was initially monitored in the medical icu from to , largely due to concern for respiratory decompensation given her underlying myasthenia. she was evaluated by neurology in the emergency department, and her respiratoy difficulties were thought most likely to be related to her primary pulmonary processes (pneumonia and chf), rather than to myasthenic crisis. nevertheless, at some point her steroid dose was increased from prednisone 15 mg daily, alternating with 20 mg daily, to a maximum of solumedrol 125 mg tid (this was not done per neurology team). her pneumonia was treated with levofloxacin and azithromycin. on her respiratory status worsened, so that she became increasingly hypercarbic and hypoxemic. she was transferred back to the micu, where she was electively intubated due to concern for impending respiratory failure. at that point her antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin, flagyl, and aztreonam. her chf was treated with diuresis. neurology and neuromuscular were re-consulted, and at this point it remained unclear whether myasthenic crisis was the major factor in her respiratory failure, as the chf and pneumonia (which on repeat cxr had become multifocal) were also major contributing factors. nevertheless, to be safe she was started on plasmapheresis, beginning p.m., for 5 treatments. her mestinon was held while she was intubated, as it can increase secretions. her respiratory status improved so that she was extubated on , and transferred to the medical floor on . on her steroids were weaned to prednisone 30 mg tid, but her mestinon was not restarted, nor was her standing home lisinopril or lasix. she was maintained on metoprolol for blood pressure control. she continued to have persistent peripheral edema, crackles on lung exam, and an oxygen requirement. on the morning of ms. myasthenia acutely worsened. she was unable to open her eyes or to hold up her head. she was given mestinon 30 mg, after which her exam improved, but due to the risk of impending respiratory failure (as she had significant work of breathing) she was transferred to the neurology icu for close monitoring and further management. her course in the icu, by systems, was as follows: 1. neuro: her prednisone was continued at the same dose, 90 mg per day. mestinon was restarted at 30 mg tid. she completed her 5 courses of plasmapheresis on . during her time in the icu her neurologic status gradually improved, so that her neck flexor strength improved to 45 (compared to 4-5 upon transfer to the unit) and her ptosis and vertical gaze weakness improved. she was evaluated again by the neuromuscular team, who felt that her decompensation was not likely related to the steroid wean, and agreed with restarting her mestinon and continuing the plasmapheresis which finished on . 2. id: her multifocal pneumonia was treated with a 10 day course of vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl (finished ). blood and urine cultures were negative. 3. resp: her nifs were stable at -20 (although sometimes she could not make a good seal with the machine), and vital capacity ranged from 450-600. she continued to have crackles on lung exam and received iv doses of lasix prn. her home po lasix was restarted at 40 mg daily, then increased to 60 mg daily. her o2 requirement remained 2-4l nc. she continued treatment with nebulized albuterol and atrovent. 4. cv: home lisinopril was re-started. the metoprolol was discontinued as beta blockers can worsen myasthenia. this plan was discussed with the medicine consult team (who recommended restarting the beta blocker when able, but from a myasthenia standpoint this was not possible). she remained peripherally edematous. 5. heme: her hematocrit dropped significantly on the day before transfer to the icu (from 35 to a low of 24 on ), and she was transfused 2 units of prbcs, followed by 20 mg iv lasix. iron studies revealed severe iron deficiency anemia (although her mcv was normal), and she continued her iron supplementation (325 mg daily) as at home. stool guaiac and rectal exam revealed no evidence of occult blood. she did have significant ecchymoses all over her body, but was receiving subcutaneous heparin injections for dvt prevention. 6. gi: no evidence of gi bleed. mild persistent abdominal distention since admission. stool regimen maintained. occasional, but not persistent, loose stools. c.diff negative. 7. renal: mild hematuria (25-50 wbc), likely traumatic in etiology, due to foley catheter. 8. endo: maintained on insulin sliding scale on she was transferred out of the icu to the neurology floor. her hospital course there is as follows: 1. myasthenia: from a neurologic standpoint, her strength continued to slowly improve and her medications were slowly weaned so that at discharge she was taking prednisone 20 mg q am, 30 mg q afternoon and 20 mg q pm. mestinon was maintained at 30 mg q 8 hours. her prednisone should be weaned over the next 1-2 weeks to 20 mg tid. at discharge her nif was -50 and her vc was 900. 2. respiratory: her respiratory status continued to stabilize. the pulmonary service was consulted while she was on the neurology service and felt that her initial respiratory failure was multifactorial including her pneumonia, atelactasis, hypoventilation, myasthenia, and volume overload. they recommended supplementary o2 to maintain her saturations above 90%. once she has recovered from her pneumonia she should undergo pulmonary function tests and potentially a sleep study to evaluate the benefit of bipap. she was diuresed with lasix and at discharge was taking 40 mg daily which is what she was taking prior to admission. she also continued to use standing albuterol and atrovent nebulizers. at rehab her respiratory status should be closely monitored initially with frequent o2 saturation checks. 3. heme: the hematology service was consulted for an anemia workup which revealed anemia of chronic disease for which she was started on supplemental iron, folate, and b12. she also had an isolated elevated ptt which was thought to be most likely due to heparin effect although, given her family history of disease, studies were sent and were pending at discharge. 4. endocrine: she was started on insulin nph 15 and a humalog sliding scale to control her blood sugars while she was on prednisone. as her prednisone is weaned down, she will likely require less insulin. 5. cardiovascular: her home lisinopril was continued. her metoprolol was not restarted as this is contra-indicated as she recovers from her myasthenia crisis. her lasix was continued at 40 mg po daily with goal of keeping her fluid status even to slightly negative. she should have electrolytes checked intermittently as she required occasional potassium repletion. 6. access: a picc line was placed in the left arm and a cxr confirmed its placement in the svc. 7. code status: full code. . dispo: she was discharged to acute rehab to continue physical therapy and manage her medical issues including her respiratory status, her fluid status, her steroid taper and her steroid induced hyperglycemia.

date: discharge date: date of birth: sex: m service: cardiac surgery history of present illness: this 68-year-old white male was transferred from hospital for cabg. he has a 20 year history of cardiac complaints and was treated with pericarditis 20 years ago and then was free of complaints until 5-6 years ago when chest pain recurred. the patient had a positive stress test, but refused cardiac catheterization at that time. he was started on medications and was noncompliant with these. over the past six months, he has had increasing episodes of angina with minimal exertion relieved with rest, and at times associated with radiation to the left arm. he denies nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. he was admitted to hospital on with angina. he had a positive stress test and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed a 50% left main lesion, 70% left anterior descending artery lesion, small circumflex lesion, and an 80% right coronary artery lesion. he had an ejection fraction of 60%. this procedure was complicated by a retroperitoneal bleed, and he was transferred to for a coronary artery bypass graft. past medical history: 1. hypertension. 2. benign prostatic hypertrophy. 3. history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. 4. history of hiatal hernia. 5. history of irritable bowel syndrome. 6. history of dysphagia status post esophageal dilatations x3, the last of which was six months ago. 7. history of hemachromatosis. 8. status post transient ischemic attack three weeks ago and with a head ct scan which revealed an old lacunar infarct adjacent to the frontal of the left lateral ventricle. 9. history of carotid disease, the left is 100% occluded, the right has a 50% occlusion. 10. osteoarthritis. social history: he works as a heavy equipment operator. he lives at home with his wife. does not smoke cigarettes. he does not drink alcohol. review of systems: unremarkable. physical examination: on physical exam, he is a well-developed and well-nourished white male in no apparent distress. vital signs stable, afebrile. heent examination is normocephalic, atraumatic. extraocular movements are intact. oropharynx is benign. neck was supple, full range of motion, no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. carotids are 2 and equal bilaterally without bruits. lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. cardiovascular examination: regular, rate, and rhythm, normal s1, s2, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. abdomen was soft, nontender, with positive bowel sounds. no masses or hepatosplenomegaly. extremities without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. pulses were 2 and equal bilaterally throughout with bilateral carotid bruits. neurologic examination was nonfocal with equal strength bilaterally and sensation intact. on , he underwent a cabg x3 with lima to the left anterior descending artery, reverse saphenous vein graft to the diag and reverse saphenous vein graft to the rpl. cross-clamp time was 71 minutes. total bypass time 54 minutes. he tolerated the procedure well, and was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit on propofol. he was extubated that day, had a stable postoperative night. on postoperative day one, he was transferred to the floor in stable condition. postoperative day two, he had a cerebrovascular accident. he had right hemiparesis and aphasia. he underwent a mri which revealed a left icamca watershed infarct. he was not a candidate for thrombolysis and he was transferred to the csru. he did receive a blood transfusion and his status improved greatly in one day. as long as his systolic blood pressure remained above 120, the patients symptoms dissipated. he remained in the csru because he required neo to keep his blood pressure in the desired range. he was followed by neurology and they wanted to obtain an angiogram to fully assess his left carotids. his mra revealed what appeared to be a string sign intracranially. he continued to progress but remained on neo and he did have an angiogram, but it was an incomplete study and they were unable to ascertain the status of his left ica occlusion, but they still felt it was fully occluded. at around postoperative day 10, he had positive blood cultures and a positive line tip. he grew out oxacillin resistant coag negative staph and enterococcus, and was treated with vancomycin. following this, his blood pressure did improve and eventually he was weaned off the neo and transferred back to the floor on postoperative day 17. neurology recommended anticoagulation with coumadin and he was anticoagulated, and had no further residual from his cerebrovascular accident, and was fully ambulatory and conversant. he was discharged to home on postoperative day 19 in stable condition. his laboratories on discharge: hematocrit 35.7, white count

repeated three additional times. even the last series is significantly limited. however, there is no obvious intracranial hemorrhage. there are mild age-related involutional changes, and greater atrophy within the cerebellum. there is no mass effect, hydrocephalus or shift of the normally midline structures. the -white matter differentiation appears preserved but there are hypodensities in the right subinsular cortex, and one in the left subinsular cortex as well as left cerebellum, probably from small prior infarctions. the visualized mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are clear. there are calcifications of the vertebral and cavernous carotid arteries. impression: no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute process. . ct head : comparison is limited by motion on the prior scan. however, there appears to be a new focus of hyperdensity in a right frontal gyrus (image 22). although partly obscured by motion on the prior study, this focus was not seen previously. a tiny calcification in the left cental sulcus. in retrospect, this focus was probably present on the prior study. there is no evidence of infarction, and there are no other areas of suspicion for hemorrhage. conclusion: possible tiny focus of hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, possibly an acute bleed. this appears new since , but the prior scan was limited by motion. there is a tiny calcification in the left central sulcus. no other evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. . cxr: impression: markedly suboptimal film with possible process involving the left parenchymal base. . echo: the left atrium is mildly dilated. there is asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. the left ventricular cavity is small. left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (ef 70-80%), with apical cavity obliteration. an apical intracavitary gradient is identified (rest: 7 mmhg, valsalva: 58 mmhg). no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. there is no ventricular septal defect. right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. a bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. the aortic prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leafletdisc motion and transvalvular gradients. no masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is no mitral valve prolapse. no mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. the left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. no vegetationmass is seen on the pulmonic valve. there is no pericardial effusion. compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of , probably no major change. the absence of a vegetation by 2d echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested. . us carotids: 40-59% right ica stenosis. less than 40% left ica stenosis . video swallow : pt presents with a mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia characterized by mildly reduced oral control, mild swallow delay and delayed laryngeal valve closure. the pt had one episode of trace aspiration when taking a larger sip of thin liquid. aspiration was silent, but cued coughs were effective at clearing the aspirate material. the risk for trace aspiration was reduced by taking single, small sips of thin liquid. the pt was also noted to have increased oral control compared to the last videoswallow and is now able to tolerate a po diet of thin liquids and soft consistency solids. pt should only take single, small sips of thin liquid. pt was unable to swallow the barium tablet whole during the study, and should continue to have his pills crushed with purees. . recommendations: 1. suggest advancing to a po diet of thin liquids and soft consistency solids. 2. pt should only take single, small sips of thin liquid. no straws 3. please crush all pills and give them with purees. brief hospital course: 78m with hx of avrcabg, sp lung resection who presented to on with confusion and found to have global aphasia sp tpa for presumed stroke but no positive imaging who was initially given tpa and admitted to the icu. he was then re-transfered to the icu for acute bradycardia with hypotension and unresponsiveness. the bradycardia and hypotension was felt to be due to iv lopressor effect, and possibly due to pneumonia and sepsis. an abg at that time returned 6.94151101 and he was emergently intubated. femoral central access was obtained and he was transiently on levophed for pressure support. he was intubated from - , and his mental status then resolved after treating his hypercapnea and pneumonia. he was continued on a course of levaquin for staph aureus pneumonia, and his mental status remained stable. he was re-evaluated by neurology after his mental status improved and was felt to have no focal neurologic deficits. in fact, there was sufficient doubt as to whether or not he actually had a stroke on presentation since no evidence of a stroke was ever found. his mental status changes may have been due to sepsis and respiratory failure - toxicmetabolic etiologies. . for the 3-4 days prior to discharge his mental status remained clear and he continued to have improving swallowing function. he completed a course of levaquin for his penumonia, and he was afebrile. . his code status is dnrdni. medications on admission: aspirin 325mg--one tablet by mouth every day atenolol 25mg--take tablet daily lipitor 20mg--one tablet by mouth every day naprosyn

shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular territorial infarction. the ventricles and sulci are normal in size. the -white matter differentiation is preserved. the visualized paranasal sinuses show opacification of the right mastoid air cells and a small mucus retention cyst in the right sphenoid sinus. otherwise, the surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. there is a nasopharyngeal mass on the right, perhaps crossing the midline. the opacification of the mastoid air cells suggests that this has been present for an extended period of time- i.e. unlikely to be inflammatory nodal enlargement. these findings are most concerning for nasopharyngeal carcinoma or other malignancy. .. mri head: lobulated right-sided

instructions: you have been evaluated and treated for very high blood pressure, headaches, and acute kidney disease. while in the hospital your blood pressure was controlled with a combination of multiple medications. your headaches improved with better control of the headaches. also, the kidney disease improved as well but remains abnormal and needs to followed closely. . while you were in the hospital, we found that there is an abnormal mass inside your sinuses. we did not complete all the necessary testing as these should be done as an outpatient. the mass could be something unimportant, but it also could be very serious like a cancer. you should see the ear-nose-throat doctors as described below. . also, while you were in the hospital, we found that you had a urinary tract infection. you completed a 3 days cours of antibiotics . the most important next step is for you to get regular medical care. you must go see your primary doctor as soon as possible in . i have given you enough prescriptions to last you for about one week and we have arrange money for you to pay for that, but beyond the one week you should discuss with dr. on how to obtain medications and care. . it is absolutely essential that you take your blood pressure pills as prescribed. . when you meet with the doctors at the community health center please give them this list of medical problems which is below. . after you meet with your new doctor, ask them to help arrange for a follow-up appointment with the ear-nose-throat doctors here at deaconness, to discuss the nasal mass. if you have any trouble obtaining your medications, experience recurrent ha, neurological symptoms, chest pain or any other symptoms of concern to you, call dr. or go to the nearest er. followup instructions: you

on medical floor and was found to be in rapid afib with rate around 150 bpm with sbp 112. he was given 50 mg of po metoprolol which per floor team he aspirated. after that pt developed new hypoxia with sats down to 89% on ra with return to 95% on 2l. pt was then given 5 mg iv metoprolol with out change in heart rate. pt was then left in his room briefly. at this point he got up out of bed and pulled out his foley catheter with the ballon inflated. approximately 300cc blood were found in the bed side comode. pt was transferred to for rapid afib, hypoxia, bleeding, and hypercalcemia. . upon arrival to , pt in rapid afib with sbp in the 90s. he was bolused with fluids prn and started on an amiodarone gtt that was quickly converted to oral. his beta-blocker was restarted and titrated up to 50mg tid wout conversion of his rhythm. he had an equivocal speech and swallowing study. he was placed on thick liquids following a video swallow study that was concerning for aspiration. he was seen by thoracics who remained unwilling to intervene to sample tissue until his cardiac issues were better controlled. ophthalmology signed off on the patient following an mri that revealed no retroorbital mass to cause his left proptosis and a resolution of his ocular findings with continued use of erythromycin ointment. after the above management, he remained afebrile normotensive. with his cardiac issues stabilized, he was sent for mediastinoscopy. . in the pre-op holding area, anesthesia noted his respiratory rate to be in the 30s wincreased work of breathing and diagnosed chf. he was given 40mg of lasix and a micu bed was requested. in this second icu stay, his respiratory failure was treated with bi-pap resulting in improved o2sats and arterial blood gas results. . he returned to the floor and had an o2 saturation in the 90s on 3l nasal cannula. while on the floor, he was found to be bradycardic (30s) and unresponsive with a o2sat in the 60s. a code blue was called, and the patient was intubated by the responding anesthesia team. he was transferred to the micu where his course included respiratory failure likely secondary to mucus plugging collapse of the right lung in the setting of chf and pleural effusions. he was intubated and bronchoscopy was performed which aspirated copious obstructing secretions and a bronchial lavage grew oropharyngeal flora. patient was shortly extubated without complication. all antiarrhythmics were stopped. patients cardiorespiratory status improved, repeat chest xray demonstrated expansion of the collapsed right lung. . patient returned to the floor from micu stay with relative volume overload. he remained alert oriented x 3. hct dropped 3 points in setting of this icu stay, found to have right thigh hematoma at site of femoral venous line placement. abdominopelvic ct showed confinement of the hematoma to the thigh. follow-up exams showed no signs of expansion of the hematoma, hct remained stable, and there were no signs of compartment syndrome noted. beta-blockade was reinstituted, but amiodarone was held. diuresis was continued with 40mg iv lasix 1l fluid restriction with goal of -1l per day. patient responded with effective diuresis and improvement in clinical hypervolemia. respiratory status improved and pulmonary exam in combination with chest xray showed decreasing signs of pulmonary edema and effusions. given continued lack of definitive diagnosis regarding mediastinal lymphadenopathy for which the patient was admitted, radiology was consulted regarding ct-guided biopsy per thoracic surgery recommendations. a cta was performed with bicarbonate prophylaxis against contrast-induced nephropathy. radiology determined that the lymphadenopathy was not amenable to ct-guided biopsy. thoracic surgery was again consulted and at that time agreed for plan of mediastinoscopy on following several more days of diuresis. thoracic surgery also recommended ultrasound-guided thoracentesis of right pleural effusion to improve respiratory status pre-operatively. the procedure team was unable to perform the thoracentesis as there was no safe entry point for thoracentesis bilaterally due to a reported relatively high risk of pneumothorax by ultrasound, though a significant pleural effusion was noted. . following improvement in the patients upper and lower extremity edema in addition to bilateral pleural effusion following diuresis, the patient underwent right anterior mediastinotomy wflexible bronchoscopy on . his systolic pressure was in the 70s for a brief period during the procedure, which required phenylephrine and 1l of fluids intraoperatively. he tolerated extubation well following the procedure, but was sent to the micu for hypoxia and hypercarbia postoperatively. he was placed on bi-pap in the micu with improvement in abg results. he returned to the floor the following day ( ). his foley catheter was removed that evening, and he was able to void 250ccs over several attempts on the morning of . he remained afebrile and normotensive with an o2 saturation of 91-95% on 1.5l o2. postoperatively, his hct remained stable. he experienced a slight elevation in creatinine from 1.2 to 1.5 one day postoperatively, with a decrease to 1.4 on the 2nd day after surgery. . briefly, this is an 82 year old man with a pmh of chf chronic renal insufficiency admitted for tissue diagnosis by mediastinoscopy of mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the setting of symptomatic hypercalcemia whose course was complicated by multiple icu stays for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, congestive heart failure and hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. . 1) hypercarbichypoxic respiratory failure - patient does not have previous diagnosis of copd, but has 45 year history of smoking. persistent bilateral pleural effusions may be due to chf or may be secondary to suspected malignancy. previous icu stay for hypoxic respiratory failure was found to be secondary to mucous plug with right lung collapse that improved following evacuation of mucous plug by suction through endotracheal tube. most likely etiology for most recent respiratory compromise is secondary to volume given at surgery as well as sedation. goal co2 60s (baseline 50s-60s due to copd). pts co2 slightly improved w bipap, but pt refused to wear it after 3am . still hypercarbic in 80s at 9am on . pt comfortable on room air with oxygen saturation 95% at 525 afternoon. - goal for patient was to maintain o2 saturation in low 90s to maintain respiratory drive. . 2) hypercalcemia mediastinal lymphadenopathy work-up: the patient had his wu started at the outside hospital. his chest ct showed mediatinal lad and a bone marrow bx showed 3% clonal population suggestive of lymphoma. his pthrp was normal and spepupep negative. of note, he has a history of taking a large number of herbal remedies at home, some of which included calcium and vitamin d as ingredients. endocrinology team thought his herbal remedies were contributory in regard to his hypercalcemia, but did not explain the extreme degree of elevation. he was bolused with fluid and given calcitonin w improvement of his mental status and normalization of his serum calcium. he is underwent surgical lymph node sampling sd above. sp mediastinoscopy bronchoscopy - widened mediastinum most likely from lymphoma, but awaiting pathology results for confirmation. - counseled patient regarding avoidance of herbal remedies - fu pending pathology - mediastinal fluid growing gnr per initial micro report, but clarified with micro and surgery that fluid is pleural fluid, and gnr is actually debris and not true bacteria per final microbiology report. - fu blood ctx - 500 keflex q12hrs per thoracic surgery (slight erythema at wound edge, no drainage, pain) . 3) pancytopenia - current hct 26.2. he has required multiple transfusions of prbcs both secondary to icu stays (bleeding following self-removal of inflated foley as well as right thigh hematoma following femoral vein tlc placement). he received 2 units of prbcs preoperatively as well. hct has been stable postoperatively. reticulocyte count of 2.3, which is low in setting of his anemia. currently with increasing plts (152), considered hit but not likely given a negative hit antibody and negative serotonin release antibody. slowly decreasing wbc count during admission, but now stable at 3.3 to 4.3 over last week. iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation. possibly related to suspected lymphoma, but bone marrow aspiration from outside hospital showed normocellular bone marow with erythroid hyperplasia (despite 3% clonal b cells). chronic renal insufficiency with low epo may be contributing, have not yet checked epo levels. - transfuse for hct less than 21 - follow counts, awaiting mediastinal path results - recommend checking epo levels as outpatient with supplementation as needed . 4) chf - patients recent echo with lvef 70% however severe 3 mr calls into question the clinical utility of this measurement, pulmonary edema on cxr, persistent bilateral effusions. right effusion drained of 500ccs during mediastinoscopy with improvement in fu chest xray. goal for patient over last several days was to maintain o2 saturation in low 90s to maintain respiratory drive and mild diuresis with -500cc negative per day. at time of discharge, patient considered euvolemic vs slightly hypovolemic. - goal to maintain current fluid status and weight - strict io, goal for neutral to -500cc daily fluid balance - fluid restrict to 1lday - consider lasix 80mg po qd if does not maintain euvolemia - consider follow-up echocardiogram as outpatient considering valvular disease . 5) atrial fibrillation - recent onset and unclear if has ever happened before. it was associated with hypotension initially on the floor and this prompted icu transfer. in the icu, he was amiodarone loaded and started on metoprolol before call out to the floor. on the floor, the patient converted to nsr w increases in his metoprolol dosage but was mildly bradycardic upon conversion to the high 40slow 50s. he maintained his bp despite this bradycardia. cardiology was consulted at the request of thoracic surgery and they recommended lowering both his amiodarone and metoprolol doses in the setting of his bradycardia. he was being fluid resuscitated as below but was stable on transfer to for mediastinoscopy. an echocardiogram done in the setting of his new afib showed 3 mrtr. he had three further icu stays on , and his amiodarone was discontinued secondary to a bradycardic episode that was the precipitant of one of these icu stays. telemetry was discontinued on day prior to discharge. - rate controlled on beta blocker - back on coumadin, inr 1.1, continue to follow inr; goal inr . . 6) renal failure - the pt had some history over weeks of acute on chronic renal failure. this was thought to be related to hypercalcemia and improved on the floor w ivf. in the 2 days prior to transfer, his mucus membranes appeared dry and his uop dropped w resultant creatinine increase. urine lytes at that time were consistent with a prerenal picture and he was bolused with ivf. he received iv fluids in the setting of hypotension and multiple icu stays during this hospitalization, requiring diuresis upon return to the floor for volume overload and worsening chf. the patients creatinine is currently 1.4, which is at baseline - avoid over-diuresis - avoid obstructive symptoms with medical treatment of prostatic hypertrophy . 7) urethral trauma - after he pulled out his foley while the balloon was inflated, he was noted to have bleeding from his urethra and his hct dropped 3 pts acutely. this resolved with no further bleeding. post foley removal the patient had difficulty with urination, he will need to be straight cathd qshift and if the urinary retention does not resolve, he will need to fu with his urologist. . 8) left eye swelling - the patient presented to with about 10 day history of left eye swelling and conjunctival erythema. he was evaluated by opthalmology who gave an initial differential diagnosis to include conjunctivitis vs orbital metastasis. ct of the head showed subdural bleed vs calcification (calcification felt to be most likely after repeat) which was followed by another fu ct per neurosurgery 10 days later which confirmed that there was no evidence of intracranial bleeding. mri showed no retroorbital mass or avm to produce his symptoms. he was treated w erythromycin ointment and he was improving on transfer. per ophthalmology, diagnosis is idiopathic inflammatory conjunctivitis. - continue erythromycin . 9) fen - the patient had a questionable

cypher stent and successful ptca of the mid lad. no enzyme leak, peak ck 113. intraaortic balloon pump was placed and then discontinued after 1 day. the patient was treated post-mi with aspirin, plavix, lipitor, beta-blocker and ace inhibitor. she was permissively mildly hypertensive initially because of her carotid stenoses and concern for a new stroke. her beta-blocker and ace inhibitor were gradually titrated up to achieve goal sbp of about 130s. her groin checks revealed no complications and were healing well. she will need repeat catheterization in 6 months for totally occluded rca and distal lad disease. she is not a cabg candidate bo carotid stenoses and now sp lm, lad intervention. 2. rhythm - vt and afib were felt to be secondary to ischemiaperi-ischemia. the patient has no prior history of a fib. she has been monitored on telemetry and has been in nsr since . she had an episode of atrial tachycardia on and her beta-blocker dose was increased. 3. pump - ef 45% mild hypokinesis. no indications for anticoagulation. the patient has been treated with gentle diuresis to keep her euvolemic with goal .5-1l negative every day. her total los fluid balance for ccu was about 2l positive. 4. respiratory - the patient failed extubation on due to tracheal edema. interventional pulmonary consulted and she received iv steroids. patients airway swelling improved (air leak) and she was extubated successfully on . steroids were discontinued on . she was conitinued on nebulizers for cardiac wheezing and required suctioning for copious thick secretions. 5. htn - patient became more hypertensive after iv steroids were started and has been controlled with iv betablocker transiently on labetolol gtt in ccu. titrated up metoprolol and acei to goal sbp 130s and hr 60, started amlodipine, and hctz. of note, because of right subclavian artery stenosis, she has consistently lower bp readings in her right arm. 6. vascular - bilateral carotid stenoses 70-79% stenosis, no intervention warranted. there was a concern of facial assymetry and decreased left arm movement. during her ccu stay, the patient was evaluated by neurology and ct showed old lacunar infarcts and no evidence of new stroke. we were unable to do mri of brain bo ear surgery years ago with wires and recent stent. neurology recommended to optimize medical managementcorrect metabolic abnormalities. 7. endocrine - the patient was covered with iss for tight glucose control during her acute illness and while she was on iv steroids. iss was stopped after the steroids were stopped. she was also continued on levothyroxine iv ( po dose) and then changed to levothyroxine po after feeding tube was placed. 8. heme - the patient was anemic with slowly falling hct. she received blood transfusions for hct 30% on , and with appropriate increase in post-transfusion hct. there was no occult bleeding and hemolysis labs were negative. she denied pain and was not hypotensive making retroperitoneal hemorrhage an unlikely cause of her falling hct. she was trace guaiac positive x 1. her hct has stabilized over the last 3 days of her ccu stay. the etiology of her dropping hematocrit was not clear but could have been related to hemodilutionphlebotomy. we would recommend to continue to follow her hct closely. 9. gu - the patient was diagnosed with e.coli uti, foley was changed and started on levaquin. on levaquin was changed to cefepime to cover both uti and aspiration pna. repeat urine culture is pending. 10. id - on the patient was more lethargic, had increase in wbc and increased thick brownish secretion. cxr infiltration in rll. she was started on empiric coverage with cefepime 2g q12 and was pancultured. cultures are pending at the time of this summary. wbc continued to increase on cefepime and vanco was added for broad coverage. she has remained afebrile. 11. dysphonia - the patient was seen by ent because of dysphonia that started the day after extubation. dysphonia was felt to be secondary to trauma post-extubationvocal cord edema. no management changes were recommended at the time. she will need to fu in clinic in weeks after discharge. 12. fengi - the patient failed swallowing evaluation and dh tube was placed under fluoro guidance because of laryngeal edema. she was started on tube feeds that were slowly titrated up to goal 55 cc

hospital course: 82 yo woman with wmoderate carotid dz and cad sp mi , htn, chol who was initially admitted to local osh for progressive doe and ruled in for mi. she was transferred here where cath : 80% lmca and t.o. rca. not great lad touchdowns. preserved lvef45%. because of rapid afib, polymorphic ct, she had emergent lmca stenting on . since then has had a number of issues including: mental status changes (pna delerium, dementia, old cvas), aspiration, uti, chf, respiratory difficulty in ccuintubated. on she had an episode of acute pulm edema for which she received iv ntg and lasix. on tranfer back to the team, the plan was for gentle diuresis, htn control, possible peg, minimize sedatives and general supportive care. her clinical status worsened, she became septic, and was transferred to the icu. 1) sepsis: as pt had failed speech and swallow eval x2, it was thought that the source of her sepsis was pulmonary. on the floor, she received vanc, ceftazidime for hap, aspiration, line infection. she was transferred to the icu and was initially on nonrebreather, but developed hypoxia, hypotension, was oriented only to person (but baseline dementia, thus difficult to evaluate) electively intubated (pus came out), right subclavian placed. pt resuscitated with 13l nslr, one unit of blood and plat. became more hypoxic on 100% fio2 possibly due to fluid overload. pressors initiated. dopamine made her tachycardic. placed on vasopressin and levofed and paralytics. her left hand and foot became hypoxic, turning blue, and pulses, which were dopplerable at admit, became non-dopplerable. clindamycin was started for aspiration pna. blood cultures subsequently came back for mrsa, so the vanc was continued. her hospital course remained relatively stable. she came off pressors briefly, but became hypotensive off pressors, so they were restarted. pt was unable to come off the vent because of her extensive pna and bilat pulm effusions. a family meeting was called, as her chances for recovery diminished. it was determined that ms. would not wish to continue living in the current state. she was made cmo and pressors, meds, and ventilator support were withdrawn. she passed away with her family at bedside. cad: asa, plavix, statin. bb, acei held given low bp. rhythm: remained in sr- held amio given low bp. hypothyroid: levothyroxine was continued.

at the time. hospital course: the patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit to be followed from a pulmonary standpoint as well as close cardiac monitoring. over the next few days in the medical intensive care unit, the patient was treated with antibiotics as well as noninvasive ventilation with a bipap mask. the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab on due to continued episodes of congestive heart failure while being treated for pneumonia. catheterization revealed a severe calcific aortic stenosis as well as moderate mid lad lesion, faint collaterals to the right coronary artery, severely tortuous right iliac artery and occluded left iliac. the patient was taken to the operating room on by dr. where he underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm pericardial valve. he also had repair of an ascending aortic dissection with a patch graft and he had a coronary artery bypass graft x2 with a left internal mammary artery to the lad and a saphenous vein off of the left internal mammary artery graft to the om. postoperatively, the patient was on an epinephrine drip. he was transported from the operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit. the patient had some significant hypotension on the night of surgery in the cardiac surgery recovery unit and an emergent transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained which showed no significant change from his previous echocardiogram done intraoperatively and no new aortic dissection. on postoperative day 1, the patient was on epinephrine drip as well as lidocaine, nitroglycerin, propofol and insulin drip. he had a temperature to 101.3. he was in normal sinus rhythm. he was stable hemodynamically on the aforementioned drip and he had been kept sedated due to initial hemodynamic instability. later in the day, the patient was noted to have seizure activity and still had not woken up despite his sedation being discontinued. the patient was taken for an emergent head ct scan which showed complete wire shed distribution hypodensity on the right anterior to posteriorly with the same pattern but less confluent on the left. the neurology consult was obtained and it was their impression that the patient had had a significant cerebrovascular accident intraoperatively or postoperatively. it was their recommendation to obtain an eeg to treat the seizure activity with dilantin, as well as benzodiazepines and to hold off sedation other than the seizure treatments and to evaluate her fever source. the patient, over the next few days, remained on full ventilator support. the patient was begun on tube feeds while his neurologic status was being closely monitored. while being supported over the next few days in the intensive care unit, the patient was noted to have stabilized hemodynamically. his swan-ganz catheter was discontinued on the morning of postoperative day 5. he remained on nitroglycerin for blood pressure control and dilantin and he was being increased on his tube feeds. later in the day, on postoperative day 5, the patient was noted to have hemoptysis. his endotracheal tube was changed to a larger tube to facilitate the bronchoscope and the patient had a bronchoscopy performed by dr. who noted some blood in the area of the right upper lobe which was cleaned out and there was no continuing bleeding source identified. some old clots had been removed during the time of bronchoscopy. on postoperative day 6, the patient was difficult to assess for neurologic status because he had gotten some sedation to tolerate the bronchoscopy. on postoperative day 7, the patient was noted to have a large amount of serous fluid from his sternal incision. he had a low grade fever at the time without elevation in his white blood cell count. due to patients questionable neurologic status, he was continued to be fully supported in the intensive care unit with tube feedings and ventilator support. he had tolerated weaning of his ventilator support to a cpap load over the next few days. he was placed on vancomycin and levofloxacin due to the patients previous pneumonia, as well as having some sternal drainage. his tube feedings had been tolerated well at goal rate. sputum cultures obtained were positive for gram positive cocci as well as yeast. on postoperative day 11, , the patient was taken to the operating room for a sternal dehiscence. he underwent a mediastinal exploration with a robicsek weave of his sternum at that time. the patient tolerated the procedure well. he had begun, over the previous two days, to open his eyes spontaneously and follow occasional command. on postoperative day 11, the patient was noted to be moving all extremities spontaneously with intermittent episodes of following commands. on , a dermatology consult was obtained due to a new rash that was evident on the patients left leg. it was the thought of the dermatology service that this was herpes zoster and the recommendation was to discharge acyclovir which was initiated at that time. on , because the patient had made significant process from a neurologic standpoint and was beginning to follow commands appropriately and be more wakeful and interactive, it was felt appropriate for the patient to undergo tracheostomy and peg placement. these were both done on by dr. , dr. and dr. which were done in the intensive care unit at the bedside. the patient tolerated both procedures well. also, on the same day, , we obtained an infectious disease consultation due to a report of vancomycin resistant enterococcus from the sternal fluid. the consultation was obtained for assistance with antibiotic management. it was their recommendation to start linezolid for a four week course, as well as to discontinue the vancomycin and levofloxacin and they recommended she continue acyclovir for the herpes zoster of the leg. the patient was again initiated on tube feedings, progressed to his goal tube feed rate over the next few days. the patient had fever to 101 on without any obvious source. his central line as well as his arterial line were discontinued and sent for cultures which are so far negative to date. since the patient has remained hemodynamically stable, requiring prolonged ventilator weaning it was felt appropriate for him to be transferred from the intensive care unit to a rehabilitation facility to progress with his neurologic and stroke recovery, as well as prolonged ventilator weaning and to continue supporting him with nutrition via his peg until he is able to take oral feeding again. the patients condition today on is as follows: he is afebrile with a temperature of 100. his blood pressure is 10843. he is in normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 90. his respiratory rate is 18. his oxygen saturation is 96%. his cvp is 14. the patient remains on pressure support ventilation at 50% fio2 with a peep of 5 and pressure support of 8. his spontaneous respiratory rate has been between 15 and 20 with spontaneous tidal volumes between 400 and 500 cc. the patient is alert and awake and interactive and follows commands with a bit of a delayed response, but is following commands consistently. pulmonary: his lungs have coarse rhonchi bilaterally. his coronary exam is regular rate and rhythm. his abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds. his extremities are warm with palpable dp and pt pulses bilaterally. the patient is tube feeding goal is full strength ultracal at 70 cc per hour. discharge medications: 1. lopressor 100 mg per g tube 2. linezolid 600 mg

episodes of vt. mexilitine was held and lidocaine drip was started but discontinued after pci on due to confusion and disorientation. on , he received his dofetilide dose somewhat late and developed persistent pulseful vt. lidocaine was re-started. the icd settings were modified and his heart rate was lowered back to 60bpm. the icd would attempt to pace him out of the vt with anti-tachycardia pacing but 13 episodes would cause him to be shocked. he recieved approximately 30 shocks. for patient comfort, he was intubated and sedated electively. with the lower heart rate in addition to switching lidocain to procainamide, the vt resolved. on - went to ep and had ablation which was sucessful. on , off of the dofetilide and procainamide, the patient was still having nsvt. ep recommended starting quinidine 324mg po tid. this was done, but then the pt developed severe diarrhea and fever that was thought to be quinidine. he was then started on procainamide, which he will be discharged on. the procainamide decreased the amount of nsvt to 1 or 2 runs of beats per 24 hours. he continues to have palpitations. b. ischemia: on admission here, he ruled in for mi and went straight to cath. he was found to have lesions in his rca. two drug-eluting stents were placed without complications. he will continue aspirin, plavix, and metoprolol. and post-op from the ep procedure, his acei moexipril was changed to captopril. c. pump: ef 10-15% per echo in , but the patient had no signs or symptoms of decompensated heart failure. he was kept on strict ios. digoxin was

relatively high doses. not hypotensive. a head ct was done for unequal pupils post-op but on clarification, he has had unequal pupils since childhood. this mental status change improved when lidocaine was stopped. 4. thrombocytopenia: his platelet count dropped slowly, heparin dependent antibodies were sent and are neg. 5. diarrhea: pt developed severe diarrhea x 72 hours after one dose of quinidine. stool studies were neg for infectous etiology including c.diff. this diarrhea was attributed to quinidine and improved with holding of the medication. 6. increasing cr: the patient was

date: discharge date: date of birth: sex: f service: this discharge summary covers the from through . chief complaint: hypoxia. history of present illness: this is a 62 year old female with pancreatic carcinoma originally admitted to the hospital on , with complaints of nausea, vomiting and dizziness. she was found to have left hydronephrosis. on the floor, she became more hypoxemic to 93% on non-rebreather and was transferred to the intensive care unit on and was intubated there. she had been started on ampicillin, gentamicin and flagyl for klebsiella urosepsis versus cholangitis on . during her intensive care unit course, the patient had four out of four blood cultures positive for klebsiella and had a percutaneous nephrostomy to relieve left hydronephrosis and an emergency room ct scan which was negative for cholangitis. the patient was treated for klebsiella bacteremia in the intensive care unit and had a left lower lobe pneumonia, and was started on ceftriaxone and flagyl. she was extubated on . she received aggressive chest physical therapy and nebulizers to allow for this but had a persistent o2 requirement upon transfer back to the floor on . her oxygen requirement there increased daily as well as her white blood cell count. on , her antibiotics were changed to a broader spectrum, zosynvancomycin, and she continued to become more hypoxemic. her oncologist, dr. saw her on the floor and was reluctant to start palliative chemotherapy until her infection issues were resolved. she was febrile on the floor up to 101.7 f., on . on the day of transfer to the intensive care unit she looked worse clinically with a saturation down to 91% on 50 liter face mask, on 90 to 93% on nonrebreather, and the medical intensive care unit team was asked to evaluate.

lower lobe atelectasis, small bilateral pleural effusions and numerable liver metastases and spleen metastases and interval resolution of left hydronephrosis. initial impression was a 62 year old female with pancreatic cancer metastatic to liver, left hydronephrosis, status post left nephrostomy, status post recent klebsiella pneumonia bacteremia with worsening hypoxia and infiltrate on chest x-ray; slightly elevated total bilirubin and leukocytosis. medical intensive care unit course by problem: 1. acute respiratory failure: the patient was initially hypoxemic believed to be secondary to congestive heart failure in the setting of aggressive volume resuscitation with sepsis. initially, the patient was brought to the intensive care unit and started on the must protocol. stim test was negative. the patients initial lactates were in the 2 range and she was given one unit of packed red blood cells for her low hematocrit. the patient initially had ambisome started, however, this was discontinued after she was afebrile for 24 hours. she had a persistent o2 requirement in the intensive care unit and was on a nonrebreather mask for two days, however, with diuresis and antibiotics she was able to avoid intubation and in fact be weaned on her high flow face mask very slowly. the patient was initiated on aggressive chest physical therapy as well as suctioning. she was able to provide sputum which did not grow out anything and after diuresis she did well. an echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction with impair left atrial relaxation and so it was assumed that the diastolic congestive heart failure could be related to her respiratory failure. the patient also had gentamicin initially started upon transfer to the unit, however, this was discontinued along with ambisome on and the must protocol was discontinued on as she was afebrile, her blood pressure stable and her lactate was only 1.2. 2. hypotension: the patient was initially hypotensive upon transfer to the unit. this improved upon diuresis. the patient was noted to become hypotensive acutely after morphine administration. a fentanyl patch was started for pain control with p.r.n. msir p.o. around the clock which seemed to hold her blood pressure up better. the patient was not on any pressors in the unit. 3. pancreatic cancer: the patient achieved pain control with morphine p.r.n. as well as a fentanyl patch. palliative chemotherapy was not an option given her infectious issues and the patients family initially wanted her to be a full code with aggressive care. however, upon multiple discussions with the family and the patient, the family is now resolved to having the patient be a do not resuscitate do not intubate and transfer to hospice; however, the patient herself wished to remain a full code and these issues remained unresolved at the time of transfer out of the unit today. her bilirubin was rising in the unit to a high of 2.4, however, it had started to fall after this and no other interventions were done. her inr was elevated to a high of 1.6, however, dropped back down to 1.3 after 5 mg of vitamin k subcutaneously. other liver function tests were stable in the unit. 4. nutrition: the patient was initially kept npo, however, she was able to tolerate clear liquids. by the time of discharge, the patient was started on tpn and was kept on tpn throughout the unit stay. 5. left picc line and a-line: right ij triple lumen catheter was pulled once a left picc line was placed and tip sent for culture which never grew out anything. the patient had a-line discontinued upon transfer back to the floor. 6. endocrine: regular insulin sliding scale, fingerstick four times a day. 7. infectious disease: urine culture positive for yeast on ; the foley catheter was replaced and a recheck of urinalysis was negative. repeat urine cultures did not grow out anything and so she was not started on any anti-fungals for this. however, she did have a positive yeast infection by clinical examination and was on three days of miconazole intravaginal suppositories. 8. depression anxiety: the patient was actively going through the acceptance stages for dying as she had been told that she has a very grave prognosis; angry at house staff at times, refusing to participate in getting out of bed or chest physical therapy at times, however, does it with encouragement. the patient was started on ritalin empirically to treat depression and fatigue and malaise while in the intensive care unit. the rest of her hospital stay should be dictated by the floor team accepting her. dr. , 12-207 dictated by: medquist36 d: 14:30 t: 15:29 job: admission date: discharge date: date of birth: sex: f service: acove medicine service addendum: the patient is a 62-year-old female. this will serve as an addendum to the discharge summary that was previously dictated. the hospital course did not change significantly for her metastatic pancreatic cancer. the patients case was discussed with her primary oncologist (dr. ) who felt that given the patients poor functional status and extremely grim prognosis that the patient was likely not a candidate for palliative chemotherapy. for hypoxic respiratory failure, the patient continued on a 50% face mask. her oxygen saturations ranged from 94% to 98%. the patient was also maintained on vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl until she completed a 14-day course; which she completed prior to discharge. otherwise, the patient had no further episodes of desaturations and no further admissions to the medical intensive care unit for hypoxic acute respiratory compromise. for diastolic congestive heart failure, the patients goals were to maintain even input and output. she was started on a beta blocker at 12.5 mg twice per day for tachycardia. the patients tachycardia was felt likely secondary to pain; although, in the setting of a deep venous thrombosis a pulmonary embolism could not be ruled out. for deep venous thrombosis, the patient had lower extremity doppler studies given that she had asymmetric lower extremity edema which were significant for bilateral deep venous thrombosis extending from the femorals to the popliteals bilaterally. the patient was started on heparin and coumadin. her inr was not therapeutic at the time of discharge and was 1.4. the patient was to be continued on heparin drip at 1100 units per hour as well as coumadin until her inr is greater than 2. this was to be continued at . for pain, the patient was maintained on a fentanyl patch which was increased to 125 mcg q.72h. her ms04 intravenous was discontinued, and the patient was continued on morphine sulfate immediate release at 30 mg one by mouth q.6h. with good pain control. for fluidselectrolytesnutrition, the patient was continued on total parenteral nutrition and full liquids. her diet should be advanced at as tolerated. the patients total parenteral nutrition orders will be sent with the patients discharge paperwork. for prophylaxis, the patient was maintained on heparin, and coumadin, proton pump inhibitor, and a bowel regimen. she was also ambulated from bed to chair. for decubitus ulceration, the patient developed a decubitus ulceration to which duoderm was applied and remained stable during her hospitalization. the patients code status was full. for hematologic issues, the patients hematocrit levels remained stable throughout her hospitalization. it should be noted that the patient has a transfusion reaction to blood and should be given benadryl prior all blood transfusions. discharge diagnoses: 1. metastatic pancreatic cancer. 2. bilateral lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. 3. respiratory failure. 4. status post nephrostomy. 5. diastolic congestive heart failure. discharge instructionsfollowup: 1. the patient should have a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician within two weeks of discharge. 2. the patient should have her electrolytes and complete blood count checked regularly as she needed transfusions and will be on total parenteral nutrition. 3. the patients inr level should also be checked to insure that she is therapeutically anticoagulated. 4. the patients diet should be advanced as tolerated so that she can get off total parenteral nutrition if at all possible. condition at discharge: the patients condition on discharge was fair. she was stable on 50% face mask without desaturations. she was tolerating total parenteral nutrition and full liquids. she was able to ambulate from bed to

operating room where he had an aortic valve replacement with a 23 ce pericardial valve. please see or report for full details. patient tolerated operation well and was transferred from or to cardiac surgery recovery unit following operation. patient did well in the immediate postoperative period, anesthesia was reversed and he was successfully extubated. on pod1 the patient complained of abdominal pain an ultrasound rod out cholestasis and lfts were normal. on pod 2 the patient experienced some post-op confusion and stayed in the icu to be monitored. ultimately transferred to the floor to begin advancing his activity level. on pod 4 the patients creatinine was elevated to 2.9 a renal us showed renal artery stenosis. a renal consult was initiated.foley was reinserted by the gu service. creatinine rose to 3.4 over the next several days. wbc rose and stool c. dificile was positive. flagyl was started. pre-renal acute renal failure continued with creatinine rising to 6.2. transferred back to the csru on . hepatobiliary consult done and -modal vancomycin therapy initiated for more complete management of c. dif. this evolved into sepsis, but the pt. refused colon surgery.id also consulted as well as general surgery for further evaluation for colectomy. a fib developed briefly and then converted to sr with lopressor. transfused on pod 12 and ct scan revealed diffusely thickened bowel. unfortunately, patients wife expired at her nursing home this week, and patient unable to attend wake and funeral. this likely contributed to his agitation and refusal to be treated. afib occurred again on and was treated with amiodarone with conversion again to sr. agitation and outbursts continued and haldol was given to calm the pt. tpn started on as pt.was made npo after not tolerating clear liquids. stool incontinence continued. his scrotum continued to become quite edematous and he developed pressure ulcers on his coccyxheels as he was not cooperative with

illness: the patient is a 69 year old male with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, status post several sntemis, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15 percent, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis monday, wednesday and friday, hypertension, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. the patient was in his usual state of health until the morning prior to admission when he awoke with acute onset of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea as well as some incontinence of stool. the morning of admission the patient woke up with shortness of breath and was diaphoretic and had chest pain. he presented to hospital and was found to have a ck of 1773 and troponin i of 62.95 and a potassium of 6.1. he was treated with four baby aspirin and was started on nitroglycerin drip, was given 80 mg of intravenous lasix, 10 units of intravenous insulin, one amp of d50, calcium gluconate, aggrastat and then became chest pain free. he was transferred to for emergent cardiac catheterization. this showed a 60 to 70 percent left main stenosis, left anterior descending coronary artery with a widely patent stent, and in the midvessel, there was 40 percent stenosis. the left circumflex had a 50 to 60 percent stenosis at the origin and a previously placed right coronary artery stent was widely patent. there was a totally occluded posterolateral branch and moderate pulmonary hypertension. hemodynamics revealed a pulmonary artery pressure of 4928, cardiac output of 2.1 with an index of 1.3, svr 2667 and pulmonary artery saturation of 39 percent. no culprit lesion was identified. past medical history: coronary artery disease, status post several sntemis, in , inferolateral myocardial infarction, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his right coronary artery. in , he had right coronary artery stent for 90 percent proximal stenosis. he was also noted at that time to have three vessel disease and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 18. his ejection fraction at that time was 36 percent. on , he had a cardiac catheterization which showed left diffuse three vessel disease, left main had 60 percent maximal stenosis, his proximal midvessel left anterior descending coronary artery had a 50 percent stenosis. he also had proximal 60 percent stenosis in the left circumflex. he also had 80 percent stenosis in the obtuse marginal two and diffusely diseased obtuse marginal three. the right coronary artery stent that was placed in , was widely patent. he subsequently had stents of the left circumflex and obtuse marginal two. a repeat catheterization was done two weeks later on , and at that time he underwent stenting to his left anterior descending coronary artery. type 2 diabetes mellitus. congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15 percent. end stage renal disease on hemodialysis monday, wednesday and friday. gastroesophageal reflux disease. history of gastrointestinal bleed. anemia. history of falls. history of cerebrovascular accident in . legally blind. diabetic neuropathy. hypertension. dyslipidemia. history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. allergies: shellfish which

saturation 96 percent on two liters. pertinent findings on examination revealed jugular venous pressure seven centimeters. he had crackles in the lateral lung fields. his heart was regular rate and rhythm. his right groin site was without hematoma or bruits. he had dopplerable posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. laboratory data: at hospital before transfer were remarkable for a potassium of 6.1, blood urea nitrogen 76, creatinine 11.0, blood sugar 318. his bmt was greater than 5000. hospital course: cardiac - there was no culprit lesion identified on his cardiac catheterization and the patient was treated medically for a non st segment elevation myocardial infarction. the patient was continued on aggrastat, aspirin, plavix and heparin. the patient was continued on beta blocker, ace inhibitor. the patient also had a swan-ganz catheter placed for optimal hemodynamic monitoring and was started on natrecor with hopes of improving cardiac output and indices through afterload reduction. because of the patients bacteremia (see below), the patient was not felt to be an optimal surgical candidate at this time. additionally, as the patient had been having rigors (see below), and was noted to have elevated cks with flat troponin and mb fractions, his lipitor was held. renal - the patient was followed by the renal team while in house and received intermittent hemodialysis. the patient initially had a tunneled right subclavian hd catheter which was subsequently removed due to bacteremia (see below). the patient eventually had a subsequent right femoral line placed for hemodialysis. until the patient was transferred to a medical team, he continued on hemodialysis. gram negative rod line bacteremia - the ctu team was called to see the patient on , at the dialysis unit when he was noted to be agitated and rigoring. the patient also was noted to have a gram negative rod bacteremia at that time. subsequent culture from the line confirmed the presence of gram negative rods. subsequently the tunneled hd catheter was removed by surgery. he was initially started on gentamicin for treatment of the gram negative rod bacteremia. ceptaz was also added to cover for possible pseudomonal infection. around this time, the patient also had been complaining of some left shoulder pain. there was a concern by the coronary care unit team that the patient could have a possible septic shoulder. a rheumatology consultation was obtained to tap his shoulder. the shoulder was subsequently tapped, however, very little fluid was obtained. subsequent analysis from the joint fluid revealed coagulase negative staphylococcus. he also had a blood culture from , which also grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus. the blood cultures from the catheter tip as well as blood cultures on , grew enterobacter cloacae that was pansensitive. the patient also had an abdominal ct to look for possible intra-abdominal source of his gram negative bacteremia. this showed linear atelectasis and scarring at the left lung base, a 5.0 millimeter nodular opacity in the right middle lobe. there were no abscesses identified. also of note, the patient was started on vancomycin for the gram positive cocci. the patient had several urine cultures which were negative. diabetes mellitus - the patient was continued on regular insulin sliding scale while he was in house. mental status changes - from the time the patient was admitted to the coronary care unit, he was noted to be intermittently agitated, often combative. a head ct was obtained to rule out intracranial bleed as the patient had recently been on anticoagulation. there was no intracranial hemorrhage or acute pathology. his electrolytes had all been normal during this time. the patient was not felt to be uremic. the most likely etiology of his mental status changes were due to his gram negative rod bacteremia. he was given haldol p.r.n. for his agitation. the remainder of the hospital course will be dictated in an addendum. , md dictated by: medquist36 d: 16:18:32 t: 13:14:33 job: name: , sr unit no: admission date: discharge date: date of birth: sex: m service: med addendum: infectious disease. the patient had an increase in his white count and temperatures while he was on the ofloxacin. multiple c. difficile cultures were drawn and found to be negative. his white count returned back to normal, and he defervesced without clear source of infection. the patients last positive blood culture for enterobacter was on . all cultures since then showed no growth. he finished a 2-week course of levofloxacin prior to discharge. episode of hypotension. the patient had an episode of hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 70s that did not respond to fluids. this occurred after 1.6 liters were taken off during dialysis. the patient was monitored in the icu overnight and received two units of packed red blood cells along with iv fluids and his blood pressure stabilized. again, there was no source for this hypotension. the etiology was likely related to hypovolemia from dialysis along with possible transient bacteremia. after this episode, the patients blood pressure remained stable. change in mental status. the patient had a change in mental status and was transferred to the icu for further monitoring. he came out of the icu the next day and this confusion did not recur. his change in mental status was likely not related to uremia since he had been dialyzed on the day of occurrence. it is unclear what the precipitating event was. the patient has had multiple episodes of delirium during his hospital stay. from the icu admission until discharge, mental status appeared to be at baseline with the patient alert and oriented times 3. the patient was transferred to the icu overnight for change in mental status. he was found to be in a respiratory alkalosis that resolved on its own within a few hours. left shoulder pain. this pain resolved prior to discharge. he had an mri of the left shoulder that had increased enhancement; however, this was after his joint was aspirated. end-stage renal disease. prior to discharge, the patient had a permanent hemodialysis catheter placed. he will continue with his outpatient dialysis regimen. initially, the patient was hyperphosphatemic during hospitalization and was kept on calcium acetate. prior to discharge, this dose was decreased because he was hypophosphatemic. cad. the patient had multiple episodes of ischemic chest pain that resolved with one nitroglycerin. earlier in this hospitalization, he had a cardiac catheterization, which showed three-vessel disease. no intervention was warranted because the patient is a poor surgical candidate. therefore, the chest pain was treated with medical management. his atorvastatin dose was increased to 80 mg by mouth every day. transaminitis. the patient had transaminitis in the setting of hypotension. a right upper quadrant ultrasound showed gallbladder thickening; however, hida scan was negative, and the patient was discharged to home with services. diabetes. the patients fingersticks were on the lower side; therefore, his nph dose was decreased to 5 units and nph subcutaneous every morning. this need to be monitored as an outpatient and increase as needed. discharge condition: stable, ambulating on room air, pain free, afebrile, with lfts trending down. final discharge diagnoses: end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. three-vessel coronary artery disease. non-st elevation myocardial infarction. diabetes, type i. congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20 percent. enterobacter bacteremia. gallbladder thickening. intensive care unit psychosis. delirium. respiratory alkalosis. constipation.

of discharge. 2. dysphagia: the patient has cricopharuyngeal dysplasia, disphagia and hyperplasia for which the patient has received a peg to receive gastric feeidng. the patient was evaluated by speech and swallow who agreed with diagnosis of cricopharyngeal dysphagia. the patient was cleared for a puree diet with small daily snacks of pureed food and liquids under supervised conditoins only and strict aspiration precautions. the patient only cleared for p.o. foods following strict swallow recommendations from speech and swallow including as follows: the patient to take a bite of pureed food, hold in mouth and tilt chin towards chest wall, swallow hard three times and then take sip of thin liquids, hold in mouth, tuck in to chest, swallow hard two to three times, cough and swallow again. myometry surgery is recommended for this patient by dr. from ent surgery in one to two months, when patients nutritional status improves. 3. neurologically: the patient was continued on dilantin for childhood epilepsy. given the patients new hemodialysis, the patient should have three dilantin levels checked q. five days. the patient will be continued on dilantin dose of 300 three times a day followed by three dilantin levels. during hospital stay, the patient also had change in mental status. for patients change in mental status the patient was started on low dose risperdol 0.5 mg q. h.s. this dose may be discontinued in the future if the patient clinically remains stable. this dose should not be increased as it will lower the patients seizure threshold. during the hospital course the patient was found to be somewhat sundown and somewhat deliriuos and most liely etioloyg of this was patients hypertension. once the patients blood pressure was under better control and the patient was on low dose risperdol, mental status was much clearer. 4. infectious disease: the patients hiv status was that patients haart therapy will be started as an outpatient. the patient is to follow-up with infectious disease clinic. 5. hypertension: the patient suffered from malignant hypertension which was extremely challegnging to deal with throughout the hospital course. the

secondary to hiv. past unspecified substance abuse. the remainder of the patients stat discharge summary will be dictated later. this part of one of two discharge summary. , m.d. dictated by: medquist36 d: 16:16 t: 18:25 job: name: , unit no: admission date: discharge date: date of birth: sex: m service: addendum to discharge summary: cardiovascular: the patient received an echocardiogram which showed left ventricular systolic function and greater than 55%, right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were also normal. there was no pericardial effusion. neurological: the patient received an mri of the head which showed confirmation of the previous known signal abnormalities in the occipital and parietal lobe regions bilaterally. given the patients history of hiv disease, presumptive diagnosis of progressive multi-focal leuco-encephalopathy was made although could not rule out the diagnosis such as hypertensive encephalopathy. the patient received an lumbar puncture which was negative for gc virus, negative for acid fast bacilli, negative for gram stain, negative for cryptococcal antigen, and other signs of meningitis. virus was also negative thus making the diagnosis of progressive multi-focal leuco-encephalopathy very unlikely. renal: the patient received a kidney ultrasound. right kidney was 12.9 centimeters, left kidney was 11.9 centimeters. no stones, masses or hydronephrosis was reported. overall normal examination of the kidneys. should the patients heart therapy consist of a dvi, the patient will need to be switched from dilantin to trileptal because of secondary reaction of proteus inhibitor with dilantin. summary of hospital course: 1. dysphagia: the patient received a swallowing evaluation and was evaluated by ent and felt to have cricopharyngeal dysphagia and hypertrophy. recommended patient receive a peg tube for feeding which was done. recommended outpatient surgical myometry so patient may resume p.o. feeding. the patient will only be able to have this once nutritional status improves. with peg feeding, the patient was cleared for pureed foods with assist as cleared by speech and swallow evaluation. 2. pulmonary status: the patient was thought to be fluid overloaded secondary to hypertension and poor renal function. hemodialysis improved the patients pulmonary status. the patients lung infiltrate and sinusitis were treated with a 14 day course of zosyn. this patient tolerated this well and improved. 3. neurologically: the patients mental status changes currently resolved. the patient is on a very low dose of risperidone. the patient received mri and lumbar puncture evaluation of pml or hiv encephalopathy. most likely diagnosis of the patients mental status changes are sundowning delirium and hypertensive encephalopathy as patients mri and lumbar puncture were not consistent with pml. 4. infectious disease status: the patient is hiv positive with high viral load with medical noncompliance in the past. the patient requests and agrees to restarting haart therapy as an outpatient. appointment was made with the infectious disease clinic for this. 5. activity; the patient worked very well with physical therapy and was able to ambulate with walker regularly with physical therapist. , m.d. dictated by: medquist36 d: 16:28 t: 19:31 job:"

is recommended with mri examination. 3. no significant change in the large pericardial effusion and left basilar effusion. brief hospital course: 1. hypotension: most likely cause was sepsis. ddx included tamponade but bedside echo in the ed revealed 1-2 cm circumferential pericardial effusion, without evidence of tamponade or rv collapse. wbc elevated at 16 and osh blood cultures taken 6 days prior to presentation to returned positive for mrsa. received vancomycin, dopamin gtt, zosyn, decadron 4 mg iv. r scl central line placed and pt started on sepsis protocol given hypotension, although lactate only 1.3 and pt afebrile. in the micu, the patient was volume repleted and his pressors weaned. levaquin was added to the vancomycin that was started in the ed but this was stopped shortly thereafter as the pt improved only on vanco. he was started on synthroid supplementation as tsh was high and ft4 low. he received another echo demonstrating no change since his er echo. as he was doing better following fluid repletion and was maintaining his pressure wout support, he was called out to the floor for further management of his condition. on the floor the pt continued to be normotensive and aldactone and lasix were restarted. pulsus paradoxus remained within normal limits. a repeat tte was done and showed moderate to large pericardial effusion with marked interval increase. further workup as below. . 2. mrsa bacteremia: suspected source of mrsa bacteremia included recent complicated pacemaker placement at osh (causing chronic pericardial effusion) vs. sacral decubitus ulcer vs. vs. le cellulitis vs. hx osteomyelitis r 2nd toe vs. infected hardware in r hip. anklefoothip x-rays wout evidence of osteo. tte was negative for vegetations. a tee was positive for filamentous, mobile, echodensities on the ra pacing lead cw thrombus or vegetation. an id consult was obtained and it was recommended to add on rifampin 300mg . it was suggested to remove the device but this was not pursued as the risk of the procedure were thought to outweigh the benefits. also, it was considered uncertain whether the vegetations on the pacemaker wires truely represented an infection. a course of vancomycin and rifampin for 6 weeks was suggested, until the . then a esr should be repeated and the abx course should be prolonged by two weeks if the esr is still positive. afterwards the pt will have to stay on lifelong suppression therapy assuming the pacemaker is colonized. doxycycline could be choosen as the mrsa is susceptible to this antibiotic. the pt should have weekly cbcdiff, bun, crea, alt, ast, alk phos, tbili and vanco trough. results should be faxed to , for the id fellow, , to review. he remained afebrile on the antibiotic, wbc normalized and the pt clinically improved. a picc line was placed to allow for outpatient antibiotic treatment. . 3. pericardial effusion: ddx includes infectious (bacterial, fungal, viral) vs. malignant vs. mechanical related to recent pcm placement. according to the pts cardiologists oral report the pericardial effusion hd been noted even before the pcm was placed. echo on admission was most consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. tte did not show any signs of tamponade or vegetations. pulsus paradoxus remained within normal limits on the floor and the pt remained normotensive. a tee showed a trivial pericardial effusion. a repeat tte was done and showed moderate to large pericardial effusion with marked interval increase. on the a pericardiocentesis was performed and 450cc of serosanguinous fluid were removed. a drain was placed which subsequently yielded 180cc over the next 24 hours. the pt remained normotensive, afebrile and with negative pulsus paradoxus. the drain was removed on the subsequent day and the pt was called out to the floor for further management. prelimninary analysis showed a negative gram stain, negative afb smear , no fungus isolated, cx ntd. cytology was pending. the pt remained normotensive with a normal pulsus paradoxus. follow up will be with dr. . pt will have a repeat echo on the at 2pm. dr. will contact him with the results after that and will make an appointment with him. . 4. hypoxia (92-95% on ra). concerning for pe. lenis indicated old thrombus involving the right superficial femoral and popliteal veins, no acute venous thrombosis involving either lower extremity. no evidence for pe on cta. most likely related to pts chronic lung changes and osa. pt on oxygen 2l as needed on ambulation at home as well as on bipap at home. home bipap settings were continued in the hospital. pfts are recommended as on outpatient. . 5. rle cellulitis with osteomyelitis: cellulitis continued to improve and was resolved on day four of admission. bone scan was suggestive for osteomyelitis in the r ankle. vancomycin treatment as above. . 6. sacral decub ulcer: no sign of infection. wound care consult obtained: suggested wound gel (duoderm gel) then duoderm layer on top. protect with dry foam adhesive over entire area. the pt was placed in a kinair bed to allow for better healing. ft was adviced on frequent turning. . 7. chf: ef 55% on echo. bnp 300 at outside hospital. aldactone and lasix were restarted on day three of admission. as the bp normalized, diureses was enforced until pt reached a euvolemic state. the pt was weaned of oxygen and was kept io even during the rest of the hospital stay. . 8. afib sp pcm placement: rate well controlled. pacemaker was interrogated and was functioning as expected. pt continued on amiodarone. anti-coagulation was held as it was thought to possibly aggravate pericardial effusion and pt also had recent hx of gib. aspirin 325 was started. . 9. hypothyroidism: pt was found to be hypothyroid with a tsh of 20. synthroid supplementation was initiated. further workup should be pursued as an outpatient . 10. anemia: concerning for gib as pt with recent gib (egd and colonoscopy negative at osh), but guaiac negative during admission. hemolysis labs negative. no suggestions for bleeding from other sources. received 1u of blood . iron studies cw anemia of chronic disease. vit

cholecystitis,. no ascites. ct of the head showed no hemorrhage, normal ventricles and sulci. there was a focal region of encephalomalacia in the right frontal lobe, but otherwise unremarkable. assessment: 47-year-old female with history of substance abuse and question of seizure disorder in the past, asthma status post dilaudid and klonopin overdose who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with mental status change, rhabdomyolysis, transaminitis, and hypercarbic respiratory failure now transferred to the medicine floor after extubation, improved, for further management. hospital course: 1. medication overdosepsychiatry: on transfer to the medicine floor patient was maintained on a one-to-one sitter and was followed by psychiatry throughout her hospitalization. given her mental status change she was not restarted on her antidepressants. psych and toxicology both were following the patient. as far as from a toxicology standpoint, patient shortly had her n-acetyl cysteine discontinued on transfer to the medicine floor since her liver function tests began to trend downward. it was unlikely that patient overdosed on tylenol, but the n-acetyl cysteine was kept on per toxicology recommendations for hepato protective effects. patient showed no signs of benzodiazepine withdrawal and was maintained on a clinical institute withdrawal assessment scale for several days and required no ativan per ciwa scale. the ciwa scale was subsequently discontinued after events on , which will be discussed below. the patient showed no signs of narcotics withdrawal with no nausea, vomiting, or any other associated symptoms. currently at time of this dictation patient is awaiting inpatient psychiatric treatment either at a rehab facility or at . 1. mental status change: initially on transfer to the medicine floor patients mental status seemed slightly improved, although patient still was disoriented and somewhat confused. it was thought initially that patient most likely had a toxic metabolic encephalopathy from her overdose. initial eeg, which was checked on , was consistent with a diffuse encephalopathy. given patients very high liver function tests, decision was made to hold off on dilantin loading on transfer on given possible hepatotoxic effects on dilantin and a questionable history of seizure disorder in the past but no evidence of seizures at the time of transfer. over the next several days from to patient began to appear more lethargic and her mental status declined. she received no valium to explain her mental status change, and the valium per ciwa scale was discontinued. a head ct was checked on to rule out anoxic brain injury and results showed bilateral hypodense zones in the main inferior orbital portion of both frontal lobes as well as a 2 cm triangular area of decreased absorption in the right frontal lobe suggesting chronic malasic change in frontal lobes. dictation suggested a questionable history of prior trauma, and thus it was thought that her head ct was stable. it was most likely chronic change from previous head injury. it was thought that patient still may likely have a toxic metabolic encephalopathy. however, during the course on patient began to manifest a worsening mental status and stopped following commands and was not responding even to sternal rub. at the same time patient spiked fevers to 102 and 103. at 5 p.m. on patient became tachycardiac in the 100s. systolic blood pressure rose to the 160s when they had previously been in the low 100s and temperature rose to 102 with a respiratory rate of 40. heent exam showed dilated pupils that were minimally active, scleral icterus with bulging sclerae. funduscopic exam was performed which showed no papilledema. neuro exam: as mentioned above, patient was not responding to sternal rub and no withdrawal to pain. she was not opening her eyes or following commands. her deep tendon reflexes were still 2 plus throughout with downgoing babinskis. with the mental status change and fever, it was concerning that patient was either suffering from a seizure, benzodiazepine withdrawal, or some other neurologic process. patient was given 1 mg of ativan times one for question of seizure and benzodiazepine withdrawal but with no effect. stat chest x-ray showed a question of an aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe, but this was most likely secondary to mental status change and not the cause of recurrent fever and mental status. blood cultures were drawn which showed no growth. urinalysis was negative. at this point it was attempted to perform an lumbar puncture. head ct had just been performed the night before and there was no papilledema on funduscopic exam. it was felt comfortable to perform the lumbar puncture. several attempts were made by two differential physicians and lumbar puncture was unsuccessful on the evening of with no fluid retrieval. there were no complications at the attempts. abg was also checked at that time and it was 7.54, pco2 of 29, and pao2 of 99, suggesting a respiratory alkylosis. of note, patient was also given two units of fresh frozen plasma for an elevated inr of 1.7 prior to lumbar puncture. since patient was and the lumbar puncture was unsuccessful on the evening of patient was empirically placed on ceftriaxone 2 grams q.d., vancomycin, and flagyl for coverage of aspiration pneumonia. the patient continued to spike fevers throughout the night of and on patient was not responding to sternal rub, following commands, or responding to any pain. her white count was elevated at 15,000. a tox screen was checked which was negative. at 9 a.m. on patient had a grand mal seizure with tonic-clonic movements that were generalized and witnessed by the nursing staff. the seizure resolved after a few seconds. patient was given ativan 2 mg times one, but the seizure had already resolved. her temperature was 103 at that time and her saturations were initially at 95 percent on 2 liters, but they decreased to 70 percent 4 liters. patient was put on 100 percent nonrebreather with only an o2 saturation at 94 percent on nonrebreather. anesthesia was called to intubate the patient for airway protection. they performed a nasotracheal intubation most probably secondary to mouth rigidity. patient was emergently transferred to the medical intensive care unit after intubation. repeat head ct at the micu showed extensive cerebral edema primarily in the white matter in a pattern consistent with reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome. there were open ventricles and the basal cisternal spaces remain visualized. neurosurgery was consulted and it was felt that patient would most likely benefit from some type of intracranial monitoring device. patient was given mannitol q. 6 hours to keep serum osms less than 320, four units of fresh frozen plasma, and had an intracerebral pressure monitor placed as well as an external ventriculostomy drain. patient had cerebrospinal fluid sample sent from this drain which showed no signs of infection. csf showed only 1 white blood cell and normal glucose and total protein. patient had the drain placed for one day and intracerebral pressures remained stable and the drain was discontinued on by neurosurgery. repeat eeg still showed just diffuse encephalopathy. mri of the head was unrevealing. patient was initially started on dilantin and then transitioned to keppra for ease of usage and no monitoring. patient was also treated with meningitis doses of ceftriaxone 2 grams q. day for a total of a seven-day course completed on for empiric coverage of meningitis since lp could not be performed in the acute setting, and patient had received 24 hours of antibiotics prior to shunt placement and retrieval of csf. even at the time of this dictation it is still unclear why patient had this diffuse cerebral edema, and there have been no clear hypotheses as to why this may have occurred. patient was transferred from the icu back to the medicine floor after improvement of her mental status and discontinuation of the intracerebral pressure monitoring and patient has been alert, lucid, and her mental status has been stable. she is alert enough to give a thorough history and is aware of her surroundings as well as her caretakers, which is quite different from her initial presentation. as far as her seizure disorder, she will continue with the keppra and has not manifested any further seizures. fevers: it is unclear whether patient may have had an aspiration pneumonia so she was treated briefly with a course of clindamycin which was subsequently discontinued after her second transfer to the medicine floor since her chest x-ray from was entirely clear. the patient did complete a full course of seven days for a treatment of meningitis with ceftriaxone 2 grams per day since it was unclear what precipitated her event. patient had a mild low-grade fever on , but this has resolved and she has had no further infectious issues at the time of this dictation. she is currently on no antibiotics. transaminitis: patients liver function tests continued to decline and it was thought likely that patients transaminitis and increased inr were secondary to ischemic liver injury from her initial event. these ast and alt are almost at normal levels at the time of this dictation. rhabdomyolysis: patients rhabdomyolysis also continued to improve throughout the course of her hospitalization. at the time of this dictation her ck level is now down to 500 from a peak of 26,000, and it is felt there is no need to follow these since they have continued to trend downwards. patient was maintained on aggressive intravenous hydration at first and now is continuing on maintenance fluids since she continues to have poor p.o. intake. nutrition goal: patient initially presented with decreased mental status and was not able to take nutrition, but since her mental status has improved patient has passed a speech and swallow evaluation and is tolerating good pos. would continue to encourage fluid intake. access: patient had a right femoral groin line placed initially when she was in the unit and this was subsequently discontinued on her first transfer to the medicine floor. however, when she decompensated with a grand mal seizure and was intubated, she had a left ij placed in the micu. this left ij remained in place until when it was discontinued. the catheter check has been sent for culture since the line site was somewhat erythematous. the culture data is still pending at the time of this dictation. disposition: patient has been working with physical therapy and has been regaining her strength daily. she still requires some assistance with moving around, but this is felt that it would likely improve with further strengthening. the decision is currently being made at the time of this dictation whether to transfer the patient to the inpatient psychiatric unit or to discharge the patient to psychiatric unit at . it has been confirmed that patient does indeed have insurance, medicare. discharge condition: stable. discharge status: still unknown at the time of this dictation but likely to an inpatient psychiatric facility with a rehab potential. a discharge addendum will be added to cover the medications and follow-up plans. , md dictated by:

the trauma icu where he was evaluated by the trauma and ortho spine team. an mri was attempted to further characterize the spinal injury however, despite sedation the patient was not cooperative with this. upon further discussion with the ortho spine service, it was decided that the best management of the c-spine injury would be a cervical spine collar w torso extension x 3 months. the pt was placed in this collar and subsequently transfered to the floor on hd 4. once on the floor the pts mental status started to decline and he developed a tachycardia. geriatrics, cardiology, and neuro-behavioral consults were obtained. a urinary tract infection was noted and levofloxacin was intially started and broadened to include vancomycin once the culture results returned. in addition, a cta was done to ro pe given the pts tachycardia and increasing oxygen requirement. the cta was neg. on hd 7 the pt spiked a fever to 102.6 and antibiotics and iv fluids were continued. later that

vessel cad. the left main was a long vessel with mild plaquing. the lad had an ostial subtotal occlusion and a proximal total occlusion. the distal lad filled faintly by left to left collaterals. the lcx was modest av groove vessel with small om branches. the ramus intermedius was large with a 30% mid vessel lesion. the rca had diffuse plaquing to 30% proximally. there were some septals providing collateral flow to the lad. 2. resting hemodynamics demonstrated cardiogenic shock. right sided filling pressures were markedly elevated with a mean ra pressure 18 mm hg. left sided filling pressures were also elevated with a mean pcw pressure of 24 mm hg and lvedp of 23 mm hg. cardiac index was markedly depressed at 1.0 lminm2, based on an assumed oxygen consumption index. there was no evidenc of a gradient across the aortic valve on pullback of the pigtail catheter from the left ventricle. moderate pulmonary hypertension was present. 3. an 8 french 40 cc intra-aortic balloon pump was placed via the right common femoral artery. there was appropriate augmentation of the diastolic pressure and unloading of the ventricle. after balloon augmentation, the cardiac index rose to 1.8 lminm2. 4. successful pci of the proximal lad with a 2.0 x 18 mm pixel stent, post-dilated with a 2.5 mm balloon at 18 atm (see ptca comments). 5. abdominal aortography was performed with a 4 french tennis racquet catheter using 30 cc of contrast at 15 ccsecond. there was adequate runoff with mild diffuse plaquing in the bilateral iliac and right common femoral arteries despite the presence of the iabp sheath. final diagnosis: 1. one vessel cad. 2. cardiogenic shock. 3. successfl pci of the lad for acute anterior myocardial infarction. echo: the left atrium is moderately dilated. the right atrium is moderately dilated. a patent foramen ovale is present. the inferior vena cava is dilated (2.5 cm). the left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. there is severe global lv hypokinesis with distal septal and apical dyskinesis. the basal to middle septum is thinned and akinetic. a large, non-mobile thrombus is seen in the left ventriclar apex (2.0 x 3.0 cm) extending down the distal septum. the right ventricular cavity is dilated. right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. the aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. there is no aortic valve stenosis. mild (1) aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild to moderate ( ) mitral regurgitation is seen. there is no pericardial effusion. ct of the chest with iv contrast: bilateral axillary, left internal mammary, precarinal, and subcarinal lymphadenopathy is again noted, unchanged since the prior study. left subclavian approach swan-ganz catheter terminates within the left main pulmonary artery. a focal area of soft tissue within the left ventricular cavity presumably represents the patients known thrombus. the heart is enlarged but there is no pericardial effusion. the appearance of the lungs is unchanged since the prior study. again, seen are multifocal areas of parenchymal opacification in a peribronchovascular distribution as well as smaller nodular opacities. peripheral left basilar opacities are again identified associated with a small amount of pleural fluid. the airways remain patent to the level of the subsegmental bronchi bilaterally. ct of the abdomen with iv contrast: oblong hypodensity extending from the splenic hilum to the posterior aspect of the spleen likely represents a splenic infarct. a smaller area of decreased attenuation is identified as well. the splenic vein and artery appear patent. the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, and right kidney appear grossly normal. there is a peripheral area of hypodensity involving the left kidney in a single image, possib ly representing a renal infarct. left kidney otherwise enhances and excretes contrast. stomach and visualized loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable. the aorta and its major intra- abdominal branches appear patent. there is no free fluid within the abdomen. ct of the pelvis with iv contrast: a small focus of gas within the urinary bladder, presumably related to prior instrumentation. the distal ureters, seminal vesicles, and pelvic loops of bowel appear grossly normal. there is no free fluid within the pelvis. bone windows: no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified. impression: 1) unchanged appearance of bilateral peribronchovascular airspace opacities as well as multiple peripheral poorly defined nodular opacities. differential diagnosis remains unchanged and includes infection, septic emboli, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and vasculitis. 2) stable appearance of mediastinal and axillary lymphadenopathy. 3) findings consistent with splenic infarcts involving the posterior aspect of the spleen. 4) focal area of hyperperfusion within the lateral mid pole of the left kidney possibly an infarct. 5) ill-defined soft tissue within the left ventricle presumably represents the patients known left ventricular thrombus. ct head wo contrast: there is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, minor or major vascular territorial infarct. -white matter differentiation is preserved. note is made of a mucosal retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. osseous and soft-tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable. impression: no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or other acute intracranial pathology. eeg: this is a discontinuous bedside eeg telemetry from -29 that was abnormal due to the presence of a low voltage background rhythm with occasional low voltage periods of delta and alpha frequency activity. these findings suggest deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and are likely a medication effect due to propafol. as the record progressed, higher voltage, hz delta frequency activity was seen. this also suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with an encephalopathy that, again, may be due to a medication effect. during the recording, intermittent arm twitching and upper body fasciculations were noted and there was no evidence of seizure activity. no lateralizing abnormalities were seen. sinus tachycardia was noted. : right upper quadrant ultrasound: comparison is made to a ct scan dated . liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormalities. there is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. the common bile duct measures 2.2 mm in diameter. the portal vein is patent with flow in the appropriate direction. there is mild distention of a sludge containing gallbladder. the pancreas is normal in appearance. there is a small amount of pericholecystic fluid as well as focal wall edema. small amount of ascites is present adjacent to the right lobe of the liver. there is a small right pleural effusion. impression: mildly distended sludge containing gallbladder, small amount of pericholecystic fluid and focal wall edema as above. these findings are concerning for, but not diagnostic of, cholecystitis. if there is continued clinical concern for cholecystitis, a hida scan is recommended. hida: negative right axillary lymph node biopsy: hiv-associated adenopathy with follicular involution, lymphocyte depletion, follicular dendritic cell hyperplasia and histiocytic hyperplasia see note. ct of the chest without intravenous contrast: in comparison with the previous examination, there has been marked interval progression of bilateral patchy and nodular pulmonary parenchymal opacity consistent with multifocal pneumonia. there is a new large right-sided pleural effusion and interval increase in size of a moderate left pleural effusion. the visualized portions of the heart and pericardium appear unchanged. visualization of the mediastinal structures is limited due to lack of iv contrast. the airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally. limited images of the upper abdomen, including limited images of the liver, spleen, and stomach, appear unremarkable. bone windows: bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions. there is significant motion during image acquisition, which limits visualization of fine osseous detail within the ribs, particularly on the right. impression: significant interval progression of bilateral pulmonary parenchymal consolidation consistent with multifocal pneumonia. interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions. microbiologyserology work-up: urine legionella negative dfa negative for influenza on admission induced sputum negative for pcp, cryptococcal antigen negative ebv serology negative cmv viral load negative galactomannan antigen positive on first assay (false positive on zosyn), then negative on repeat testing. bartonella serology negative monospot ngative toxoplasma serology negative stool positive for c. difficile. - c. diff negative x3 sp treatment (last test on neg). wound swab from peg site: pseudomonas but thought to be colonization by id. no signs of abscess or deeper infection on abd ct. urine culture: pseudomonas thought to be colonization by id. ua neg x2. id recommends against treatment. sputum gram stain: gram neg rods and gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters. ngtd ua: clear; uctx: ngtd all blood cultures ngtd brief hospital course: ap: 46 year-old male with hiv previously on haart, admitted with 1 month of doe, chf symptoms, found to have anterior st elevations on ekg in ed and total occlusion of lad in cath lab, status post stent placement (bare metal stent) on , also with bilateral pulmonary infiltrate on cxr. his hospital course will be reviewed by problems as it was complicated by multiple issues. . 1) cv: a). cad: as mentionned above, mr. was taken to the cath lab on where he was found to have total occlusion of the lad and received a bare metal stent. right heart catheterization showed elevated pcwp of 26 and mvo2 sat of 24%, with ci of 1.0. an iabp was placed with improvement in ci to 1.8, and dopamine was initiated. he was subsequently transferred to the ccu for further care. it was felt that the mi was not acute given the low enzyme levels (troponin 0.08, flat mb on ) but most likely represented an event a couple weeks old. of note, plavix was held in anticipation for invasive diagnostic procedures for his pulmonary process. he had a heparin coated bare metal stent placed on , and plavix was stopped despite such a short course. it was not restarted due to persistent bleeding from epistaxis. . b). pump: an echo on revealed an ef 10-15% and an apical lv thrombus, and mr. was started on heparin iv. during his course in the ccu, he was switched to milrinone for inotropic support, and diuresis was initiated given elevated filling pressures and poor ef. lasix and milrinone therapy were tailored to increase his cardiac index by following pap values. during this part of the hospital course he had several episodes of svt responsive to lopressor, and later had nsvt for which milrinone wean was accelerated. as tolerated by good cardiac index, he was weaned off the iabp and started on ace-inhibitor, and weaned off milrinone. digoxin was also started and coreg was added. . he was transferred to the floor on , stable on ace inhibitor and bb. on the second day on the floor, he became hypotensive and developed a fever to 102.5. he was given fluids and placed on dopamine out of concern for sepsis and possible cardiogenic shock, and transferred back to the ccu. over that night he was switched to levophed as he was too tachycardic on dopamine. a swan was again placed and the numbers were consistent with cardiogenic shock and superimposed sepsis. pressors were changed to milrinone. . he has remained on milrinone since his transfer back to the ccu, and has been on intermittent ace inhibitor therapy (held in the setting of hypotension and rising creatinine). we were eventually able to titrate lisinopril to 5 mg po qd. therapy was tailored to the patients bp and urine output once the pa line was out. few attempts to wean milrinone have been unsuccessful because of hypotension. the chf service was consulted, with recommendations to start digoxin for inotropic support, and transfuse to keep hematocrit 30, both of which were done. of note, while in the ccu, mr. had recurrent episodes of complete heart block, and digoxin was discontinued. he was also diuresed with lasix boluses prn for goal daily even to negative fluid balance. at some point he was so fluid overloaded, he required lasix gtt with additional boluses to attain euvolemia. . however, the patients congestive heart failure continue to worsen throughout his course. at first, the patient wished to be dnrdni with continued measures to save his life including milrinone. the swan was discontinued with persistently low cardiac indexes in the 1.4 range on milrinone. however, the patient then reversed his code status as he was given the hope that he might recover. despite this hope, the patients congestive heart failure worsened to the point that recovery is slim and he will remain dependent on milrinone for the rest of his life. meanwhile, he would occasionally drop his pressures and require levophed. on dobutamine, he developed ectopy and this was stopped. at the patients familys request, dr. from , a heart failure expert, came to evaluate the patient and agreed that the patient would not be a candidate for a left ventricular assist device or heart transplant as the patient has no intrinsicly preserved heart function to support such a thing. furthermore, his pulmonary status is so poor that he would not tolerate a heart transplant. in addition, dr. from the brighham also offered a second opinion in which he at first suggested repeating a ct scan of his chest, improving his nutritional status and repeating an echocardiogram to assess the patients improvement and consider lvad. however, a repeat ct scan showed minimal improvement of the patients boop on prednisone, a repeat echo showed decreased systolic function and although he is at goal tpn, his nutritional status will not further improve. therefore, the patient has been denied by the for further intervention as well. . the patient continued to be dependent on milrinone and levophed for inotropy and pressure support. multiple attempts were made to wean down the levophed dose in an attempt to dischargetransfer pt to homefloor, however this proved very difficult due to repeated episodes of hypotension. on the last days of his hospitalization, his hypotensive episodes became worse most likely secondary to sepsis and he required higher and higher doses of leveophed to maintain pressures. at some point, the levophed was not able to support his blood pressure and max dose milrinone was unable to generate sufficient forward flow to maintain tissue perfusion. . c). rhythm: the patient had been tachycardic to 140-160s since admission but was started on amiodarone on and had shown signs of better nodal control. the patient only had occasional episodes of tachycardia after wards. he was therefore continued on amiodarone at 100mg once daily dose (lower than normal dose due to history of significant bradycardia with full dose amiodarone). the patient was continued to be observed on telemetry as well during his hospitalization. . . 2) pulmonary: a). pulmonary infiltratesboop: given his initial cxr with bilateral patchy infiltrates, mr. was started on levoquin for coverage of atypicals and cap organisms. id was consulted. he was placed on isolation out of concern for possible tb, and bactrim was added pending rule out pcp. cd4200 and negative induced sputum x2, bactrim was discontinued. vancomycin was added for gram positive coverage. a ct chest was eventually performed to further characterize his pulmonary lesions, and revealed bilateral conglomerated central peri-bronchovascular opacity with air bronchograms as well as multiple peripheral scattered poorly defined nodular opacities and foci of ground-glass opacity and lymphadenopathy. the differential diagnosis included atypical infection, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, atypical vasculitis, sarcoidosis, and neoplastic processes such as kaposi sarcoma and lymphoma. an extensive non-invasive work-up including induced sputum for pcp, , legionella, as well as blood cultures, sputum cultures, cryptococcal antigen, chlamydia psitacci, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, chlamydia pneumonia, bartonella titers, was non-revealing. he also did not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics. . pulmonary was consulted, along with id and a tissue diagnosis was recommended. a vats was felt to be the best diagnostic procedure. however, thoracic surgery declined vats given the patients tenuous respiratory and cardiac status. attempt was made to perform a bronchoscopy with biopsy on but was aborted given the patients tenuous hemodynamics. the yield of such a procedure was also anticipated to be low, and the riskbenefit ratio of elective intubation was not favorable. given his generalized lymphadenopahy, he underwent a right axillary lymph node biopsy on . initial pathology reports were suggestive of an atypical tumor. however, further evaluation was felt consistent with hiv adenopathy with non-specific histiocytic proliferation, and the biopsy turned out to be non-diagnostic. special stains and immunophenotyping were also unrevealing. . given the above, mr. was started on empiric steroid and antifungal therapy on . heme was also consulted, who felt that his pulmonary process was unlikely to be lymphoma. in the differential were ks, cop (boop), lymphoma (unlikely), infection (unlikely). on , a galactomannan antigen came back positive at 0.79 (drawn on ). given this positive result, caspofungin was changed to voriconazole, and steroids were dcd. a repeat galactomannan was sent on . the patient was on zosyn at the time of the first sample, which can cause false positive results. the repeat galactomannan eventually came back negative. given this negative result as well as lack of clinical and radiographic improvement, antifungal therapy was discontinued after completion of a 7-day course. . a repeat chest ct was performed on , which revealed stable pulmonary infiltrates. after discussion with pulmonary and id services, empiric steroid therapy was reinitiated on . a repeat ct chest performed on showed slight radiographic improvement, and methylprednisolone was changed to prednisone 60 mg po qd. he will need at least 6 months of therapy for presumed boop (cop). of note, bactrim prophylaxis was also initiated given repeat cd4 186 and steroid therapy. . the patient was treated empirically for boop on prednisone which has been tapered to 50 mg from 60 mg, with a slow taper over 6 months. a repeat ct scan after at least a month of steroids showed minimal improvement. he continued to have a rapid respiratory rate but expressed his wish to be intubated if needed. pulmonary no longer followed the patient and we continued steroids and bactrim prophylaxis. furthermore, we discussed the patient with id who recommended no additional hiv prophylaxis. . b). respiratory failure: this is most likely secondary to volume overload from end stage heart failure. the patient was intubated for severe respiratory distress with tachypnea to 60s, sao2 of 80% on nrb and abg of 7.43443 on nrb. the patient remained tachypneic and was overbreathing the vent, possibly due to the sepsis or other metabolic derangement. the sedation was increased sequentially in attempts to better control his respiratory status. he was unable to be extubated prior to expiration. . . 3) id: please see above for work-up of pulmonary infiltrates. as mentioned above, mr. was started on levaquin on admission for coverage of cap and atypicals. vancomycin was eventually added for improved gram positive coverage, and he completed a 7-day course of both antibiotics. . on , he became hypotensive and developed a recurrent fever to 102.5. vancomycin and levofloxacin were restarted, and zosyn was added to broaden gn coverage. he continued to spike fever despite broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. an extensive infectious work-up, including induced sputum for pcp, , legionella, as well as blood cultures, sputum cultures, cryptococcal antigen, chlamydia psitacci, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, chlamydia pneumonia, bartonella titers, was non-revealing. he had a positive femoral catheter tip culture on positive for enteroccus, felt a likely contaminant. all antibiotics were dcd on . stool cultures were positive for c. diff on , and flagyl was started. oral vancomycin was eventually added on given ongoing diarrhea. vancomycin was dcd on and flagyl was dcd on . he has been afebrile since . . a peg tube was placed on , complicated by significant pneumoperitoneum. hence, broad spectrum antibiotherapy was reinitiated with vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl. the patient completed this course of antibiotics without difficulty and remained symptom free until when his white count began to rise. this was felt to be no surprise as the nursing staff reported seeing the patient self-contaminate himself on many occasions by touching his stool and then touching his nose and mouth with the same hand. on , the patients white count rose to 17 and although he had not yet spiked, he was pancultured and placed on vancolevoflagyl empirically for a day course without ever manifesting any sx, the vanclevofalgyl course was completed. . the patient complained of significant hoarseness and dysphaga in his throat. he was initially treated symptomatically with viscous lidocaine and improved oral hygiene. in addition, he was started on fluconazole for treatment of oral thrush which was thought to be the causative organism. cmv viral load in was negative, however repeat viral load on was 6200. id was consulted regarding treatment for cmv esophagitis, however they did not recommend treatment without a tissue diagnosis given the multiple toxicities of gancyclovir. a tissue diagnosis could not be obtained due to the fragile nature of the patients cardiopulmonary status which may have led to earlier respiratory failure and intubation. . the pt spiked a temperature to 101 again on (3days post intubation) at which point he was started on vancomycine for presumed mrsa vap. gram positive cocci were found in the sputum gram stain. on day 4 of intubation, the patient spiked a temperture to 104 and ultimately reuquired a cooling blanket and around the clock tylenol to defervese. the patient was started on levofloxacin and flagyl in addition to the vancomycin. he subsequently dropped his pressures requiring inc. doses of levophed suggesting he was in severe sepsis. a repeat sputum gram stain showed gram postivie cocci as well as gram negative rods suggesting the causative organism were most likely mrsa and pseudomonas. antibiotics were continued, however he expired from overwhelming sepsis and multi organ failure refractory to two max dose pressors. . during the course of his admission, the patient was found to have a low cd4 count and the decision regarding re-starting hiv med was deferred from id to pcp . who has been following his hiv care. ultimately his hiv meds were not re-started due to the signfiicant side effects of the medication given the patients many complications and acutely ill state. . . 3) neuro: on , in the setting of recent hypotension and high fever, mr. had a seizure and required intubation for airway protection. neurology was consulted. ct with and without contrast showed no bleedmass, electrolytes were essentially unchanged, and lp was without infection (although it was remarkable for an elevated total protein). eeg was consistent with diffuse encephalopathy, possibly medication-related. given negative work-up, his seizure was felt most likely in the setting of fever. per neurology, he was started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. the latter was eventually changed to keppra in the setting of elevated lfts. he has had no recurrence of his seizure, but has been intermittently confused with poor short-term memory. the possibility of a thalamic stroke was raised by neurology, but he subsequently improved and further work-up was not pursued. . given his ongoing tachypnea and - breathing despite radiographic improvement and fair chf control, the possibility of a central process was again raised. attempt was made to obtain a head mri on which was aborted given patient agitation and inability to lay still. . he remained on keppra 1gm po bid which was discontinued early in as it was felt that this medication was not necessary to prevent further seizures. this was discussed and agreed with by neuro. . . 4) renal: pt developed atn (muddy brown casts in urine) most likely secondary to transient ischemic insult from hypotension. duration of oliguria was very short 24hours followed by extensiv diuresis (post atn diuresis) despite cessation of diuretics. this was complicated by frequent episodes of metabolic alkalosis: given his significant diuresis as well as the inc. bicarb, the patient was thought to be in contraction alkalosis. as well as fluid over load. these fluid balances were managed with differing levels of diuretics including lasix bolus to gtt as well as acetazolamide, natrecor and renal dosed dopamine gtt. his fluid balances remaiend difficult to manage throughout his stay. in addition, the patient had frequent electrolyte imbalances which were also difficult to manage due to their wide fluctuations. this ranged from signficnt hyponatremia to hyperkalemia as well as hyperkalemia which were all managed clinically. . . 5) gi: a). elevated lfts: on , mr. was noted to have elevated lfts. interestingly, he had elevated alp ggt ast and alt. peak alp 1457, ast 271 and alt 128 on with normal bilirubin. a ruq ultrasound was performed on which revealed a mildly distended sludge containing gallbladder with a small amount of pericholecystic fluid and focal wall edema. given theses results, a hida scan was performed, which was normal. hepatology was consulted on with an impression of drug-induced liver disease versus infiltrative process (infection or lymphoma), although the latter was felt unlikely. dilantin was felt to be the possible culprit, and was weaned to off. he was transitioned to keppra for seizure prophylaxis, with parallel improvement in his lfts. however, as kepra affects lfts, this was discontinued without further issues. his lfts continued to trend down and were felt to be elevated secondary to hepatic congestion. . b). pancreatitis: the patient developed acute ruq pain with elevated amylase and lipase. the ruq us showed sludge in cbd suggesting possible pancreatitis due to sludge from chronic tpn. pt was placed on bowel rest and tg were taken out of tpn. although ercp or mrcp would have been ideal to ascertain and possibly treat the ongoing gi process, gi believed he would most likely not tolerate either procedure. therefore a decision was made in conjunction with the gi team to persue a conservative management as above. the amylase and lipase did decrease slowly almost normalized prior to expiration. . . 6) apical thrombus: the patient has a large left ventricular apical thrombus secondary to poor lv function. as a result, he was bridged to coumadin. however, during the week of , the patients inr rose suddenly to as high as 9.5 and he developed spontaneous epistaxis that required 4 blood transfusions and 4 units of ffp. ent was asked to evaluate the patient and placed nasal packings to prevent further epistaxis. they placed the patient empirically on cefazolin while the packing remains in place. his coumadin was held in the setting of these nosebleeds. once the packing were removed and the patient was able to maintain appropriate hct, he was started on loevenox 30mg for two weeks followed by heparin gtt for treatment o his apical thrombus. . . 7) fen: poor po intake in the setting of tachypnea and critical illness. he refused ng tube and dob hoff placement, and was started on tpn on . he finally underwent peg tube placement on at the bedside with gi and anesthesia present. post-procedure, incidental note was made of significant abdominal free air on ct chest. he also complained of ongoing abdominal pain. an erect cxr revealed significant free air, and surgery was consulted. a gastrograffin ct abdomen was performed on which showed no extravasation of contrast indicating a leak. . the peg tube was used initially with high residuals and increased abdominal pain. repeat films showed persistent air in the peritoneum a month after the peg placement which was felt not to be unusual. it was felt that by using the peg, the patients abdominal pain was significantly worse than if he received tpn through a picc. therefore, we have continued to provide him tpn nutrition and disontinued the peg tube. the patient was encouraged to continue on a fluid-restricted, brat-like diet. however the patient was known to eat sardines and chinese food which exacerbated his congestive heart failure and precipitated a sharp decline in his function and caused increased abdominal pain. multiple discussions regarding moving the peg tube to pej tubes were undertaken during his hospital course, however neither gi, ir, or ip was willing to perform the procedure given the patients significant comorbidities and high risk of intubation. the patient was continued on tpn until his expiration. . . 8) code status: the patient has significant heart disease with severe lv dysfunction (ef of 10%). as such, he was unable to create any forward flow without max dose milrinone and additional pressure support with levophed. as per our transplant service (and two other independent cardiologists from outside institutions), he was not a candidate for heart transplant or lvad secondary to pulmonary hypertension and significant rhf. in addition, he has had significant complications including boop, lv thrombus formation with significant epistaxis secondary to supratherapeutic inr, worsening immunosuppression from hiv, with cmv infection and atn. throughout his hospital course, we had multiple discussions with the family regarding goals of care. over the last several days of his hospitalization, he developed severe sepsis from what appears to be gpc and gnr of unclear origin. given his underlying heart condition and all of these complications, his prognosis was poor. during the last days of his hospitalizations we had multiple discussions with the hcp, the family, ethics service as well as palliative care service daily to address goals of care. the hcp communicated to the team her desires to stop any additional treatments. she was interested in taking treatment regimens away with the understanding that we will not re-start them. on the last day of his hospitalization, he was unable to maintain pressures despite max dose milrinone and levophed and he was having high fevers despite multiple antibiotics. given the rapid and what appeared to be fatal progression of his many illness, the hcp made the patient dnr and dni. the patient expired later that afternoon. medications

date: discharge date: date of birth: sex: m service: cardiothoracic allergies: patient recorded as having no known allergies to drugs attending: chief complaint: severe chest and back pain with fever and leukocytosis major surgical or invasive procedure: - cardiac catheterization. placement of iabp - cabgx3 (left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending and reversed saphenous vein graft to the marginal branch and the posterior descending branch. - placement of an iabp - exploratory laparotomy history of present illness: this is a 59 yo male with a past medical history significant for diabetes, hypertension, question of sarcoidosis who presented to the emergency department with fever, chills, and back pain. patient states that he has had the back pain for months but now the pain is more localized to his midline. the patient states that he has had diarrhea for the last couple of weeks but in combination with constipation. pt denies any dyspnea, diaphoresis, melena, hematuria, dysuria. in emergency department, mr. was febrile to 102.9. he was initially worked up for aortic dissection and had a ct of the chest and abdomen. an ekg was done after he returned from ct and he was found to have st elevations, .5-1mm in i, avl and 2 mm in v2. he was urgently taken to the cath lab where he was found to have a 90% ostial lesion of the left anterior descending artery, 50% stenosed circumflex artery and an 80% stenosed right coronary artery. hemodynamics showed a cardiac output of 5.76, an index of 2.44 and a sytemic vascular resistance (svr) of 444. no intervention was made as patients left anterior descending artery lesion was near the circumflex and there was concern for blocking left coronary ciculation as patient was left side dominant. an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and mr. was transferred to the floor for stabilization with antibiotics for infection, and potential evaluation for surgical revascualrization when stable. upon leaving the cath lab, he became hypotensive. he was started on low dose dopamine but then he became tachycardic so pt was switched to neo-synephrine with good relief. upon arriving to the floor the patient had a white cell count of 25. he was started on empiric coverage of vanomycin, levofloxacim and flagyl. the white cell began trending up from 23.4 on admission - 26.5 - 36.8 - 46.1. later linezolid was added when it was found that he had a history of methicillin resistent staph aurea (mrsa) and vancomycin resistent enterococcus (vre) from past wound infections. pt on the floor trended upwards from 259 - - 3352. cardiology fellow called about possibility of taking patient to cath lab in light of continued ischemia. it was deemed that due to pt anatomy, he was not a candidate for peructaneous intervention. when mr. initially came to the floor his blood gas (abg) was 7.342894 with a lactate of 1.4. he was found to have a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. he was on a nonrebreather and then transitioned to cpap. a 3am gas showed 7.2547131 w lactate of 2.1. he seemed to be tiring and anesthesia was called to intubate mr. . chest x-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrate. he was transitioned to low volume to mimize barotrauma for suspected acute respiratory distress syndrome. other issues included a rising creatinine of 2.3 (baseline 1.5-1.8)on and a question of vertebral osteomyelitis. id consult was obtained and the abx recommendations were followed. he also developed hyperkalemia and was seen by renal service for arf. pt. also had a small gi bleed with ngt coffee grounds emesis on heparin. iabp was removed and treatment continued for lle cellulitis. he also continued lasix duresis with periodic neosynephrine support. he was extubated on . referred to dr. of ct surgery. he recommended infectious issues be competely resolved before cabg and a myocardial viability study. patient contnued to have episodes of diarrhea. he continued his courses of vanco and zosyn.cabg was scheduled but then postponed for a rising creatinine again (2.2). dr. reviewed the high risk status of his surgery with the patient (10-15% mortality). cabg performed on by dr. with a lima to lad, svg to om and svg to pda. he was transferred to the csru on epinephrine, levophed, milrinone and insulin drips.he was extubated on . pressor wean was begun and epinephrine and levophed were off later in the day. pt. remained on lidocaine, milrinone, and neosynephrine drips. chest tubes were removed. creatinine was 2.9 on . he had an episode of vt and had cardioversion on . he was also transfused and started on a natrecor drip. swan was exchanged to a triple lumen catheter on . ep was consulted for recurrent vt. amiodarone drip was started. he also had episodes of rapid afib. on , he had a vfib arrest and was shocked x 4. cath was considered but his creatinine was at 3.0 at the time and cardiology felt it best to monitor him closely. ischemia was not suspected given the large area of his anterolateral infarction.the following day it was 3.2. he continued to receive sq heparin for his mobility status. he remained on amio, natrecor, and lidocaine drips and continued with zosyn. he was diuresed with lasix drip for volume overload. on the afternoon of , the pt. was reintubated for respiratory distress. he went to the cath lab for iabp and swan placement. heparin was switched to iv dosing. milrinone and neo drips were restarted. on , a quinton cath was placed in the left femoral vein to allow for the institution of cvvhd. he remained sedated with propofol. tee was performed on which revealed severely depressed lv function with ef 20-25%.a small pericardial effusion was noted and there were multiple wall motion abnormalities including anterolateral akinesis. on , he had a run of afib, torsades and a 23 beat run of vt with poor perfusion and severe hypotension. he was cardioverted and then paced. he had 4 ble edema. right dp pulse was not dopplerable at this time, and toes were cyanotic, but warm. iabp was pulled at 4:30am by cardiology for the compromised circulation in that leg. he remained somewhat hypotensive at this time (sbp 70-80s). vascular surgery was called when the pulse did not return in this foot. he continued to be severely acidotic with base excess of minus 4 to minus 16. there was slight improvement in his doppler signal, but ischemia with thrombus was considered. platelet count was 69k at that time with an inr of 2.3. at this time, there was concern for his bowel circulation given his acidosis that was not responding to therapy. the patient remained critically ill and ischemic mesentery was suspected by the transplant service. mr. was seen and evaluated by dr. of general surgery. he had requested correction of the coagulopathy and additional lfts in preparation for emergency exploratory laparotomy. the patient was taken to the or on the morning of and had an emergency lap by dr. . during the attempted bowel resection for mesenteric ischemia, the patient suffered vtach and a vfib arrest that did not respond to multiple shocks, cpr, and acls protocol meds. he was pronounced expired at 10:24 am by dr. of transplant surgery. past medical history: charcot foot - vremrsa past infecftions hypertension hyperlipidemia diabetes mellitus questionable sarcoidosis morbid

obscured by metal artifact but much of the remainder of the heel and foot is well-seen. cardiac catheterization 1. severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction. 2. severe primary pulmonary hypertension. 3. placement of iabp brief hospital course: mr. was admitted to the medical center on for further management of his chest pain. he was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have severe three vessels coronary disease. as his left anterior descending artery was markedly calcified with a short left main, intervention was declined given the risk of jailing the circumflex artery which was his dominant vessel. an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed. heparin, integrillin and aspirin were started for anticoagulation. mr. became hypotensive after his catheterization and pressors were started. he subsequently became acidotic and required intubation in the cardiac care unit. given his leukocytosis, sepsis was suspected and vancomycin, flagyl and linezolid were started. given his charcot foot, the podiatry service was consulted. medications on admission: kcl furosemide 80 po bid allopurinol 100 mg po daily diovan hct 16025 po daily atenolol 50

forehead abrasion. pupils: nonreactive bilaterally. neck: supple with c-collar in place. chest: sounds are coarse bilaterally. there is ecchymosis over the right clavicle. there is a right chest tube in place. abdomen: soft, nondistended. pelvis: stable. extremities: extremities are warm with palpable dp pulses. there were no evident fractures or dislocations of the extremities. there are no stepoffs on the back. rectal: examination revealed no tone, guaiac negative. on discharge, mr. is comfortable in no acute distress. he is oriented to the hospital, although occasionally confused. heart: regular. lungs: lungs are clear. abdomen: soft. peg tube site has a small amount of erythema related to irritation, which is improving. extremities: warm with intact distal pulses. he is able to get out of bed with assist. laboratory data: laboratory data revealed the following: sodium 136, potassium 4.1, chloride 101, bicarbonate 28, bun 22, creatinine 0.9, glucose 86. white count 7.2, hematocrit 30.9, platelet count 380,000, pending urine culture. toxicology screen upon arrival is negative. amylase, upon arrival, is 137. summary of radiographic studies: ct of the head upon arrival showed evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage within the left temporal lobe. there was no evidence of shift of structures. the ct of the cervical spine showed right transverse process fracture of c7. there were no other fractures of the cervical spine. ct of the chest and abdomen, upon arrival, showed evidence of fracture at the right transverse process fracture at the level of the upper thoracic spine and multiple posterior right rib fractures. there are small, rounded low density lesion in the liver, with a differential diagnosis of cyst versus metastatic disease. percutaneous peg tube was placed on . negative fluid of the c-spine showed no movement of bony alignment. ct angiogram of the head showed a stable left sylvian fissure subarachnoid hemorrhage, bilateral low density subdural fluid collection without any shift and no evidence of intracranial aneurysms or vascular malformations. concise summary of hospital course: mr. was admitted to the intensive care unit after he was transferred from an outside hospital status post fall of one flight of stairs. injuries included subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left sylvian fissure, bilateral subdurals, right clavicle fracture, right c7 transverse process fracture, right hemothorax, and multiple right-sided rib fractures. hospital course: hospital course and progress will be described by systems below. neurological: mr. was admitted with subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhages. neurologicalsurgery consultation was obtained for evaluation of the hemorrhages. over the hospital course he received at least two repeat head cts. on discharge, the subarachnoid hemorrhage has improved and there are no increasing leads. there is no midline shift in the head cts on discharge. mental status over the hospital course has improved. he is now occasionally confused, however, mostly alert and able to read books. ct angiogram was obtained during the admission to rule out vascular injury this was negative for a vascular injury. cardiac: mr. remained stable from a cardiovascular perspective throughout his admission. he was started on beta blockers for hypertension control and on discharge, he is on lopressor. this maintains him at a stable rate and pressure. respiratory: mr. was intubated in the intensive care unit for the first six days of his admission. although awake and alert, his extubation was delivery secondary to a large amount of airway secretions. he was extubated on hospital day 6 and subsequently able to remain extubated. on discharge, he is comfortable and able to cough. he did require suctioning for a large part of his hospital admission. chest tube was weaned by chest x-ray and eventually discontinued. on discharge, the patient is comfortable and saturating well on room air. he does not tolerate much chest pt due to his right rib fractures. he does require suctioning occasionally to help clear his secretions. a swallow study was obtained during the hospital course, which showed aspiration with p.o. intake. therefore, he was kept on npo status to prevent an aspiration. gastrointestinal: early during his hospital course, mr. received j-tube feedings, which he has been tolerating well. he received percutaneous pej tube placement for his tube feeds. after this tube was placed, while he was on the floor, the pej tube was pulled out. the reason for this is unclear, however, this tube was replaced again by the department of radiology and was a pej tube. on discharge, he is tolerating tube feeds at goal. there has been some erythema around the tube site, which is attributed to irritation. this erythema is significantly improved without any antibiotics over the last few days prior to discharge. recommendation is to do dry dressing care for the tube site and keep the tube secured so it is not pulled. mr. is to continue on his tube feeds at goal and can be cycled as needed. he failed his swallow study late in his admission, therefore, because of aspiration risk, he is kept on npo status. on discharge, he is tolerating tube feeds, he is having bowel movements and voiding spontaneously. infectious disease: mr. is off antibiotics for days prior to discharge. his last urine culture showed pseudomonas. however, his white count continued to improve after removal of the foley. he was given two days of ciprofloxacin, after which it was stopped given his afebrile status and improvement in the white count from 12 to 7.2. on discharge, he is voiding spontaneously. he is afebrile. he has a normal white count. urine culture is pending on discharge. one of his sputum culture had h. influenzae, which was believed to be colonization at that time. serial chest x-rays have shown continued improvement. hematology: mr. hematocrit is stable at 30 on discharge. endocrine: mr. has had normal blood sugars on discharge. activity: mr. is able to tolerate out of bed to chair with assist. renal: mr. is able to void spontaneously, making adequate urine on discharge. summary: in summary, mr. presented to the hospital with a right hemothorax, head injury, and multiple right rib fractures and clavicle fractures after a one flight fall. he was intubated upon arrival. he was extubated on hospital day 6. hospital course has been significant for slow progress secondary to his age. he has recovered, however, from his injuries. on discharge, he is alert, with occasional confusion. he is tolerating his tube feeds and goal. he is voiding spontaneously. he is having bowel movements. incidentally, he was found to have multiple low-density areas in the liver, which need followup and workup for ruling out a malignancy. liver function tests were normal during admission. follow-up appointment: the patient is to followup in the trauma clinic in two weeks. phone : . the patient is to followup with the primary care physician in two weeks. the patient will likely need a colonoscopy for further workup. medications on discharge: 1. heparin subcutaneously 5000 units b.i.d. 2. zantac 150 mg per j-tube b.i.d. 3. lopressor 25 mg per j-tube b.i.d. 4. tube feeds, promote with fiber 70 cc per hour per j-tube. 5. ambien 10 mg per j-tube, q.h.s.p.r.n. 6. free water 200 cc per j-tube t.i.d. dressing care: dry dressings to j-tube site t.i.d. and local skin care at the j-tube site as needed. discharge diagnosis: 1. left sylvian fissure subarachnoid hemorrhage. 2. multiple right posterior rib fractures. 3. right c7 transverse process fracture. 4. right clavicle fracture. addendum: mr. cervical spine was cleared later in his hospital course with additional flexion and extension x-rays. the flexion and extension views were inadequate, however, the swimmers view was obtained, which was adequate, which showed no deformity. he took off his collar multiple times during this admission by himself without problems. eventually, the collar cervical spine was cleared and there was no tenderness of his neck. he is able to function without any change in his neurological status for more than a week after the cervical spine clearance. also, for his right clavicle fracture, he has a right arm sling, which can stay on for an additional two weeks. the sling can be removed for his daily activities. , m.d. dictated by: medquist36 d: 08:46 t: 09:17 job: admission date: discharge date: service: trauma addendum: his previous discharge summary had included the

she was anemic with hematocrit of 24 and thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 25,000. she received two units of packed red blood cells and 6 units of platelets and she continued to have low counts. hematology was consulted at that point and ldh was increased. the patient was transferred t on for further management of a presumed ttp. on she complained of left hand numbness, paresthesias and a left sided facial droop that lasted 15 minutes, which resolved on its own. neuro consult felt tia was the most likely cause with right mca territory. cat scan of the head was negative. mri and mra demonstrated atherosclerotic changes of intracranial carotids, right greater than left, but no stroke. mrs. began plasmapheresis on , though during her first episode she developed hypotension with systolic blood pressure to the 80s, responded to fluid boluses and she was also hypocalcemic at the time. therefore, patient was transmitted to the micu where plasmapheresis continued there. on she completed a course of plasmapheresis, her platelets had maxed at 238,000 and her ldh was 271. she needed plasmapheresis again on for decreasing platelets, increasing ldh and decreasing haptoglobin. subsequently on she developed a fever to 101. she was cultured and blood cultures grew coag negative staph aureus four bottles and the patient was started on vancomycin. she had a line exchange on . during that time her platelet count was decreasing and there was a question of infection vs dic and hit. she had an hit positive antibody at that time. plasmapheresis continued through the right subclavian catheter placed by ir with completion of plasmapheresis on the . physical examination: she had temperature 98.9, blood pressure 15070, pulse 85, respirations 20, 95% on room air. she was in no apparent distress. she was normocephalic, atraumatic, equal ocular movements intact. chest clear to auscultation. cardiovascular showed a regular rate and rhythm, normal s1 and s2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops. abdomen was benign. extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema but there was a large ecchymoses in the right groin area. neuro, she is alert and oriented times three, cranial nerves ii through xii grossly intact, muscle strength 55 throughout. back without tenderness. past medical history: as previously noted. she has hypertension, vascular disease, increased cholesterol, laryngeal carcinoma 10 years ago, status post laryngectomy, cervical cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy, angina status post epi. medications: on admission, meclizine 25 mg once a day, atenolol 50 mg once a day, iron 325 mg tid and lipitor 10 mg once a day. allergies: no known drug allergies. laboratory data: she had a white count of 8.3, hematocrit 29.9, platelet count 35, pt 13.6, ptt 26 and inr 1.1, d dimer greater than 1,000, ftp between 10 and 40, sma 10 was within normal limits. head ct on the was negative. head ct on showed no acute blood. hospital course: partially stated during hpi, patient was admitted on to from hospital. the patient had a hematocrit of 29.9 and platelet count 35 and white appeared to be a tia, so it was believed that patient was suffering from ttp. the patient developed a plasmapheresis on at which point she became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure to the 80s and hypocalcemia. therefore, patient was transferred to the micu where she tolerated plasmapheresis very well. the patients platelets came up to 238,000, ldh came down to 271 on , though it was noted that the patients platelets were decreasing again. ldh was rising and haptoglobin was low. the patient restarted plasmapheresis on . on subsequent exam on , the patient developed a fever to 101.5 with coag negative staph in bottles from the blood. she was started on vancomycin and her line was exchanged on . when patient had a fever on and the line needed exchanging, the patient was sent to the on the . the patient received right subclavian and continued on vancomycin for one week. a new line was placed on . during that time there was question of infection and dic vs hit. the patient had hit positive lab test results. patient had good renal function throughout the whole hospitalization. creatinine ranged from 0.9 to 1.1. some time on the floor the patient had one episode of chest tightness that resolved with nitroglycerin. cardiology consult believed this to be demand ischemia with minor st-t changes. troponin maxed at 1.7 and patient was treated with increased beta blockers. at that time patient was not a candidate for aspirin therapy. the patient completed plasmapheresis on for a total of 25 sessions of plasmapheresis. upon discharge the patients platelets normalized at 298,000, ldh remained within the normal limits. the patient was discharged home with home services. condition on discharge: patient is stable at discharge. discharge medications: calcitrol 0.25 mcg q day, insulin sliding scale, prednisone taper, atenolol 100 mg q day, protonix q 40 mg

lung cancer, now with ulcer in the esophagus. evaluate for cancer recurrence. soft tissue window images demonstrate abnormal esophageal wall thickening in the distal esophagus with multiple lymph nodes which are at the upper limits of normal in size, but given its proximity to the abnormal esophagus, are also likely abnormal. additionally, there are moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left. the left pleural effusion is loculated with a moderate supbulmonic component. additionally, there is subtle linear enhancement of the posterior surface of the left pleura. there is bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right, associated with the bilateral pleural effusions. the entire left lower lobe is collapsedconsolildated. in both upper lobes, there are geographic areas of opacity with traction bronchiectasis and scarring, likely relating to prior radiation therapy. an ill-defined 5mm ground glass nodule is seen in the right middle lobe. there are diffuse emphysematous changes in both lobes. at the base of the right lung, there is an irregular area which likely represents atelectasisscarring. the heart, pericardium, and great vessels are normal. in the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, again seen is ascites, a hiatal hernia, and right hydronephrosis. the visualized portions of the spleen and left kidney are normal. bone windows: no suspicious sclerotic lesions are seen. impression: 1. abnormal thickening of the distal esophagus with adjacent lymphadenopathy, worrysome for malignancy. 2. geographic areas of opacity in both upper lobes, consistent with prior radiation. 3. subtle linear enhancement of the left posterior pleural surface. while this could be due to radiation, given the history of lung cancer, pleural based metastatic disease is of high concern. 4. 5 mm ground glass nodule in right middle lobe. the nodule is somewhat ill- defined, and is nonspecific, but given the history of lung cancer, a 3 month follow- up chest ct is reccommended. 5. bilateral moderate to large pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis. the left pleural effusion appears loculated, with a moderate subpulmonic component, and there is associated complete collapseconsolidation of the left lower lobe. 6. unchanged ascites, right hydronephrosis, and a hiatal hernia. radiology final report abdomen (supine erect) port medical condition: 70 year old man with ntg, dark blood, ho partial bowel obstruction indication: history of partial bowel obstruction with dark blood in the ng tube. decubitus and supine view of the abdomen: dilated loops of small bowel are present in the right abdomen measuring up to 5 cm in transverse diameter. air- fluid levels are demonstrated on the left lateral decubitus view. the degree of dilatation of small-bowel loops appears slightly decreased compared to the study of . ct abdomen wcontrast; ct pelvis wcontrast indication: 70-year-old man with history of lung cancer, now with nausea and vomiting, and loose stools. small pleural effusions are seen bilaterally. there is a small hiatal hernia. a nasogastric tube descends below the diaphragm and terminates in the stomach. there are diffuse coronary artery calcifications, and atherosclerotic disease within the aorta. there is a large amount of intraperitoneal ascites. the liver is cirrhotic, without nodules or masses. the gallbladder is not visualized. the pancreas, spleen, both adrenals are normal. there is mild hydronephrosis of the right kidney, with delayed contrast excretion. the abdominal aorta is diffusely calcified with good contrast opacification of the intraabdominal vessels. there is diffuse dilatation of the intraabdominal loops of small bowel, measuring 4.6 cm in cross sectional diameter with multiple air fluid levels. there is fecalization of the small bowel within the terminal ileum, within the right lower quadrant. no focal masses are seen within this area. distal loops of small bowel and colon are decompressed with minimal contrast opacification of the ascending colon. there is no evidence of pneumatosis, or pneumobilia. ct of the pelvis with oral, with intravenous contrast: dense calcification of the intra-abdominal aorta increases in to bilateral iliac arteries. a foley catheter is seen within a collapsed bladder. minimal gas and stool are seen within the sigmoid and rectum. bone windows: degenerative changes are seen throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar spine. there are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormalities. there is diffuse subcutaneous edema. impression: 1) small-bowel obstruction with a possible transition point in the distal ileum, within the right lower quadrant. no focal masses are identified at this area. 2) delayed right renal nephrogram with mild hydronephrosis consistent with distal obstruction. 3) cirrhotic liver. 4) bilateral pleural effusions. 5) dense diffuse atherosclerosis of the coronaries, and intraabdominal aorta. 6) small hiatal hernia. hip unilat min 2 views right reason for this examination: please assess r femur fracture again, demonstrated is a fracture of the right femoral neck with angulation at the fracture site. there is also some degree of impaction with foreshortening of the femoral neck. the projection is slightly different than the previous study. allowing for this factor, the fracture is likely unchanged. no additional fractures are identified. extensive vascular calcifications are present. pelvis portable reason: low pelvis to view arthroplasty the patient is status post right total hip replacement procedure with satisfactory postoperative alignment on a single projection. immediate postoperative changes are noted including soft tissue gas and superficial skin staples. extensive vascular calcifications are again observed. l-spine (ap lat) reason for this examination: new-onset loss of l5 motor function, please assess for compression fx. indications: recent onset of loss of l5 motor function. question compression fracture. the bones are diffusely demineralized. there is a mild compression deformity at the l4 vertebral body level. very minimal loss of height is noted at l5 as well. the remaining lumbar vertebral bodies show preservation of normal height. the disk spaces are relatively well preserved with some mild narrowing noted at l3-l4. degenerative changes are noted posteriorly in the facet joints. extensive vascular calcifications are seen throughout the abdominal aorta and its branches. regarding the decreased height at l4, it was likely present at the time of the recent abdominal radiograph as well, but difficult to compare due to lack of the lateral view at that time. within the abdomen, note is made of multiple air filled loops of dilated bowel, which were also present on a recent ct of the abdomen of , which described a small-bowel obstruction. there is also a suggestion of ascites. impression: 1) compression deformity at l4 and very minimal compression at l5. 2) dilated loops of small bowel, concerning for small-bowel obstruction. please note that recent abdominal ct of described a small-bowel obstruction. probable ascites. ct head wo contrast indication: fall. head trauma. noncontrast head ct: there is no acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of

however, she was found to be over narcotized and required a narcan drip to alleviate this problem. on postoperative day number two, she was doing well and she was transferred to the floor. over the next few days, she continued to do well. on postoperative day four, she required some lasix for mild pulmonary edema on clinical examination. this resolved with upright positioning and the diuresis with the lasix. on postoperative day number seven, she was noted to have a large amount of wound drainage and her wound was open for copious amounts of somewhat enteric looking drainage. she went for ct scan to rule out fistula or leak. the only finding was a possible smb clot. over this time as well, her platelets dropped from 325 to 64 and then by postoperative day number seven, down to nine. hit antibody was sent. all heparin was removed from her lines and subcutaneous. zantac was stopped. dic laboratory studies were sent and found to be unremarkable. we placed venodynes on her legs for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and requested a hematology consult. the hematology consult agreed with our management and furthermore, advised holding any anticoagulation, secondary to a risk of bleed, given that her platelet count was only nine. her platelet count remained nine over postoperative day eight. early in the morning on postoperative day number nine, she became anuric, hypotensive and her hematocrit was found to have dropped to 22. she was transferred to the intensive care unit. swan-ganz was placed for fluid management. she was actively resuscitated with blood products and fluid. she was taken to the operating room for exploration of possible abdominal bleed. upon opening the abdomen in the operating room, however, the small bowel was found to be entirely infarcted with catastrophic abdominal findings. she was reclosed without any further intervention and brought back to the intensive care unit. we supported her blood pressure with pressors and fluids until her family could be fully present. at that point, she was made comfort measures only. she expired. , m.d. dictated by: medquist36 d: t: 05:07 job:"

overdiuresis. at the time of discharge to , the patient was felt to be rather dry, and therefore her lasix dose was held, and she was given a gentle fluid challenge of 500 cc. the patient responded to this with an increase in her urine output and improvement in her creatinine. a chest x-ray obtained at the time of discharge did not demonstrate any signs of heart failure, and urine electrolytes checked at the time of admission also suggested that the patient was likely dry. the patient was continued on her imdur, and a daily aspirin was added to her regimen given the likelihood of coronary artery disease. given that the patient had not tolerated reinitiation of her ace inhibitor at the outside hospital, this medication was also initially held. the patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation which is a chronic arrhythmia for her. she was therefore continued on her coumadin once her inr had fallen to appropriate levels. over the next few days, it was felt that the patient was likely peripherally but centrally volume overloaded. an attempt was made to provide the patient with enough fluid to adequately perfuse her kidneys and therefore correct her prerenal azotemia and yet not overload her poorly functioning hear to worsen her congestive heart failure. therefore over the next few hospital days, the patient was treated with a low dose of lasix, and her p.o. intake was encouraged. on the morning of , the patient was noted to have an acute episode of shortness of breath with a desaturation to the upper 80s on her 3 l nasal cannula. the patient was felt to suffer from diastolic cardiac dysfunction leading to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid from a past red blood cell infusion. the patient was treated with lasix, nitropaste, and lopressor iv to treat her tachycardia. in addition, it was felt important to restart the patients ace inhibitor in an effort to improve her renal perfusion. an echocardiogram was repeated which demonstrated a dilated left and right atrium, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mitral regurgitation, 3 tricuspid regurgitation, and new left ventricular and right ventricular systolic dysfunction, with a small pericardial effusion, and an ejection fraction of 40-45%. given the patients evidence of systolic dysfunction, her crackles on examination, and increased oxygen requirement, she was treated with low doses of lasix, and her ace and imdur were continued. over the next few hospital days, the balance was obtained between lasix iv and fluids in an effort to balance the patients fluid status; however, on , the patient had significant abdominal pain with a fairly benign physical examination. it was thought that the patient was likely experiencing mesenteric ischemia, and an effort was made to obtain an abdominal ct scan in order to verify this possibility; however, in the setting of her rising creatinine, the patient was pretreated with fluid hydration and mucomyst prior to obtaining the ct scan. in the setting of this fluid therapy, the patient developed increasing shortness of breath, low oxygen saturations, and increasing acidosis. at the same time, the patient was also being treated with narcotic medication including three doses of oxycodone 5 mg p.o. in an effort to provide pain control for the patients sacral decubitus ulcer. in the setting of fluid hydration and narcotic use, the patient had an acute episode of hypocarbic respiratory distress and was subsequently transferred to the micu. over the next four days in the micu, the patient was gently diuresed to treat her pulmonary edema and was placed on a narcan drip requiring three days of continuous narcan therapy for reversal of her narcotic induced mental status changes and decreased respiratory drive. while in the micu a renal consult was obtained who suggested that given the patients poor cardiac function, she could not maintain her baseline creatinine of 1.4, as well as clear lungs and recommended tolerating a higher creatinine in order to keep her lungs dry. it was also suggested that the patients ace inhibitor be discontinued and not restarted given that she had demonstrated multiple times in the past the inability to tolerate the ace based on increasing creatinine. while in the micu, the patients cardiovascular status improved. she maintained a systolic blood pressure of approximately 130 to 140 and tolerated aggressive diuresis of approximately 1 lday. on transfer back to the floor, the patient was felt to be euvolemic and was continued on her imdur, metoprolol 12.5 b.i.d. which was started for presumed diastolic dysfunction, nitro transdermal patch of 0.2 mghr, hydralazine 10 mg q.i.d., and a daily lasix dose of 20 mg p.o. per day. it was clear that part of the patients problem resulting in transfer to the micu were secondary to narcotic overdose and subsequent hypercarbic respiratory distress; however, given the increased lactate, significant abdominal pain, and history of severe vascular disorder, it was felt likely that the patient may have experienced an intermittent mesenteric ischemia which may have also precipitated her respiratory distress. however, the patients abdominal pain resolved in the micu, and this was never further evaluated. on transfer back to the floor, a cardiology consult was obtained in order to request aid in balancing the patients congestive heart failure and poor cardiac function with her acute renal failure. cardiology also suggested that the patients fluid status had been difficult to ascertain and manage over the past several weeks. they recommended obtaining a stress exam with a persantine thallium in order to assess for coronary ischemia which may be able to be reversed through catheterization. they also recommended titrating up her hydralazine and nitrates as tolerated. a persantine thallium was therefore obtained which demonstrated a moderately reversible defect in the inferior wall, an ejection fraction of 42%, significantly enlarged right ventricle, and global hypokinesis. review of the stress thallium with cards in the setting of the patients overall functional status and chronic illness, it was felt that she would not likely benefit from a cardiac catheterization, and the best course of action was to resume medical management of the patients coronary artery disease. over the next five or six hospital days, the patient was treated with cardiac medications including imdur, atenolol, hydralazine as tolerated, as well as continuing her nitro patch and continuing on a daily lasix dose of 20 mg p.o. q.d. the patient maintained systolic blood pressures in the 120s and demonstrated adequate urine output during this period; following placement of a peg tube on , the patient demonstrated an acute episode of respiratory distress and hypoxia. this responded to intravenous lasix, as well as 50-100% non-rebreather. by the morning, the patients respiratory distress had significantly improved, and it was felt this was most likely secondary to an aspiration event resulting in aspiration pneumonitis which has since resolved. in addition, the patients hypotension during this episode responded well to fluids, and her blood pressure was back at baseline by the next morning. over the few days following, on , the patient was treated with her continued gentle diuresis of lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.; however, on , the patient demonstrated a drop in her blood pressure to a systolic of the high 90s to low 100s accompanied by a decrease in her urinary output. reevaluation suggested that the patient was likely dry and had been overdiuresed at this point. she was therefore treated with gentle fluids including 1 u of packed red blood cells, as well as small boluses of 250 cc a piece. when these small boluses did not demonstrate a significant increase in the patients blood pressure nor urinary output, she was then placed on maintenance fluids in addition to her tube feeds. the patient received approximately 1 lday over the 28th and 29th. subsequently on the morning of 30th, the patient had an acute onset of shortness of breath with an acute desaturation to 84% on her usual 3 l oxygen. this was felt to be likely in the setting of fluid overload, and therefore, the patients maintenance fluids were stopped. she was given lasix 40 mg iv with some increase in her urinary output. in addition, the patient was tachycardiac; however, given her continued low blood pressure at the upper 90s, it was not felt prudent to give lopressor to slow her rate. given that the patient looked so uncomfortable, she was given morphine 1 mg iv. over the next few hours, the patients mental status decreased significantly as did her respiratory rate. a blood gas obtained a few hours after administration of the morphine demonstrated impending acidosis of 7.27, co2 58, and an o2 of 90. the patient was treated with 0.4 narcan with significant increase in her mental status and respiratory rate. therefore, the patient was placed on a narcan drip, and given persistent hypercarbia and acidosis, she was placed on bipap therapy and transferred to the micu. therefore in summary, the patient was thought to have coronary artery disease with significant systolic and diastolic function based on echocardiogram results. this was felt to be best managed medically with hydralazine, nitrates, and beta-blockers, and there was felt to be no benefit from a cardiac catheterization; however, the patients fluid status proved to be difficult to control as the patient persistently vacillated between being too wet and too dry. the overall plan was to maintain the patients blood pressure with a systolic of approximately 130 in order to obtain adequate renal perfusion but to also provide her the benefit of cardiac medications including beta-blocker therapy, hydralazine, and nitrates. finally the patient was started on digoxin q.o.d. in an effort to improve her systolic function and therefore improve her renal perfusion. 2. pulmonary: at the time of admission the patients initial chest x-ray demonstrated left lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis which had been present since her chest x-rays in . the patient had been treated with one week of rocephin therapy, and on transfer, was afebrile with a normal white blood cell count and no pulmonary symptoms. it was therefore felt prudent to discontinue her antibiotic therapy and follow her pulmonary exam clinically. she was also encouraged to use incentive spirometer as tolerated in an effort to improve her left lower lobe atelectasis. during the hospital stay, as detailed in the cardiovascular system, the patient vacillated between pulmonary edema and dry lungs. the patient demonstrated her best pulmonary function when treated with lasix on a daily basis despite a bump in her creatinine to a baseline of 2.0. over the first two hospital days, the patient was treated with gentle fluid therapy, and just prior to transfer to the micu, the patient demonstrated an acute desaturation, as well as hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of narcotic therapy. the patient was diuresed effectively while in the micu and then transferred back out to the floor and maintained on a daily dose of lasix for her congestive heart failure; however, over the next few days, it was felt that the patient was likely being overdiuresed, as her systolic pressure began to drop. her lasix and other cardiac medications were discontinued, and the patient was treated with fluids including small fluid boluses and packed red blood cells. however, once again in the setting of small amounts of fluid therapy, the patient demonstrated an acute onset of shortness of breath with flash pulmonary edema and was therefore treated with further diuresis, and in this instance, placed on bipap therapy and transferred to the micu. 3. infectious disease: the patient was noted to have a citrobacter urinary tract infection on presentation to the outside hospital and completed a 7-day course of rocephin therapy at that hospital. urinalysis and culture obtained at the time of transfer demonstrated a normal urinalysis with no growth in the culture, and therefore, her rocephin therapy was held. however a few days following admission, the patient began complaining of burning with urination, and urinalysis was repeated which demonstrated significant candidal growth. the patient was therefore treated with fluconazole therapy and peridium with resolution of her urinary tract infection symptoms. the patient had no further urinary tract symptoms until the 29th at which time she once again began complaining of burning with urination through the catheter. a urinalysis was resent which demonstrated significantly elevated white blood cell count, as well as nitrite positive and leukocyte esterase positive. the patient was therefore started on levaquin pending final results of the urine culture. the patient demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary infection on the multiple chest x-rays obtained during her hospitalization. the left lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis was felt to most likely represent some kind of mass or atelectasis as apposed to an infectious infiltrate. the patient demonstrated diarrhea during her hospital stay, and a c-difficile toxin was found to be positive. therefore, the patient was treated with a 21-day course of flagyl while in the hospital. the patient had no further signs or symptoms of infection up until the time of her transfer to the micu. during the entire course, the patient remained afebrile with a normal white blood cell count. 4. renal: the patient demonstrated an elevated creatinine on admission to the outside hospital which increased further with diuresis at the outside hospital and improved somewhat with hydration therapy. the patient was also felt to have possibly developed an interstitial nephritis secondary to rocephin therapy, and this antibiotic was discontinued at the time of transfer. over the course of the hospital stay, the patients creatinine was elevated to approximately 1.9 to 2.0 which was felt to be required in order to keep the patients lungs dry enough to decrease her oxygen requirement; however, following the peg tube placement when the patient began to experience lower systolic blood pressures, it was felt that her renal perfusion had decreased, and her urinary output began to decrease as well. a renal consult was reobtained, and a urinalysis was sent with sediment consistent with interstitial nephritis despite the fact that the patient had not undergone any medication changes recently. it was recommended to start levaquin therapy for a urinary tract infection and to attempt to maintain her systolic blood pressure greater than 130 to improve renal perfusion. following the episode of acute shortness of breath and desaturation on , it was recommended to attempt diuresis, and some thought was given towards the possibility that dialysis may need to be an option in the future. therefore, it was determined to begin initiation of discussion of dialysis with the patient and her husband should this become an issue. at the time of transfer to the micu, the patients creatinine had increased on a daily basis up to 3.8 with an increasing bun up to 128. 5. gastrointestinal: the patient had no complaints of abdominal pain or suggestion of pathology at the time of admission; however, her stool was sent for c-diff which was positive, and the patient was therefore treated with a 21-day course of flagyl; however, approximately four days into the hospital stay, the patient began complaining of significant abdominal distress; however, her abdominal exam remained benign. although the patients stool remained guaiac negative, she did demonstrate significant diarrhea, and given her history of significant peripheral vascular disease, it was felt that the patient might be experiencing an intermittent mesenteric ischemia. an attempt was made to obtained a ct scan to verify this thought; however, in the setting of fluid therapy and narcotic therapy for pain management, the patient developed significant hypercarbic respiratory distress and was transferred to the micu with subsequent resolution of her gastrointestinal symptoms. during the remainder of the hospital course, the patient maintained excellent colostomy output with no complaints of abdominal pain and benign abdominal exams. on , a peg tube was placed without complications, and tube feeds were initiated. the patient had no further gastrointestinal issues leading up to her micu transfer. 6. hematologic: the patient had been on coumadin for her chronic atrial fibrillation; however, this had been held secondary to elevated inr at the outside hospital. once the patients inr had fallen below 3, her coumadin was restarted, and an attempt was made to maintain her inr between 2 and 3 during the course of the hospital stay. the patient also demonstrated a low hematocrit at the time of admission, however, had normal iron studies, b12, and folate at the outside hospital. it was felt that the patients anemia was most likely secondary to chronic illness, and she was continued on her epogen shots. the patient was transfused 1 u packed red blood cells on three different occasions during the hospital stay prior to her transfer to the micu. the patients stool remained guaiac negative during the hospital stay. 7. fen: the patient was attempted on a p.o. diet with boost supplement at the time of admission; however following transfer to the micu, a swallow study was obtained which demonstrated that the patient was aspirating significantly. follow-up studies continued to demonstrate aspiration, and therefore a peg tube was placed on . the patients electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and repleted as needed. the patient will likely need continuation of her tube feeds until she has attained adequate strength in oropharyngeal control in order to refrain from aspirating. 8. wound care: the patient demonstrated a stage 3 sacral decubitus wound at the time of admission which was followed by dr. in plastic surgery. a plastic consult was obtained at the time of admission who suggested that the patients wound was healing appropriately with good granulation tissue and that no surgical intervention would be necessary at this time. the patients wound was packed with duoderm gel and normal saline gauze b.i.d. throughout the course of the hospital stay and continued to demonstrate good granulation tissue without evidence of infection. 9. neurological: the patient demonstrated a fluctuating mental status over the course of the hospital stay which was significantly altered by the administration of any narcotics or benzodiazepine therapy. approximately four days into the hospital stay, the patient was treated with oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q.6 hours times three doses in an attempt to help her gain control over her significant abdominal pain and sacral decubitus pain. following this, the patient developed an acute respiratory distress with hypercarbia and was transferred to the micu and placed on a narcan drip. following this episode, the patient was not administered any further narcotics until her acute episode of shortness of breath with desaturations . at this time 1 mg morphine was provided to the patient in an effort to provide comfort, and she subsequently developed, once again, a hypercarbic respiratory distress and increasing acidosis. she was therefore placed on a narcan drip with great improvement in her mental status. in addition in retrospect, it was found that the patients mental status was most clear when her lungs were dry and her oxygen saturations were high. , m.d. dictated by: medquist36 d: 18:26 t: 19:36 job: name: , unit no: admission date: discharge date: date of birth: sex: f service: . addendum to discharge summary: hospital course (continued): over the next few days in the medical intensive care unit, the patients significant systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction continued to be managed with hydralazine, nitrites and beta blocker. the patients fluid status persistent in being difficult to control. given that the patient did not desire any further interventions, a cardiac catheterization was not performed. persistent efforts at medical management were maintained with continuation of beta blocker therapy, hydralazine and nitrates for improved forward flow, however, the patients blood pressure did not always tolerate the continuation of these medications. the patient continued to be alternately treated with small fluid challenges for intermittent hypotension which had to be subsequently followed with efforts at diuresis, given the initiation of shortness of breath and decreasing oxygen saturations. given the patients significant cardiac dysfunction which has persisted for a long time and which had resulted in the significant decrease in her baseline functional capacity, as well as her associated renal insufficiency and sacral decubitus wound complications, a family meeting was held with the patient as well as her husband to discuss goals of care. given that the patient was responding poorly to optimal medical management, no further interventions were requested at that time. the patient and her husband agreed that she should be made do not resuscitate, do not intubate, and that the focus should be changed from optimal management to comfort measures. the patient was subsequently transferred from the medical intensive care unit back to a more private room on the wards. she was provided with morphine and ativan as needed for dyspnea as well as complaints of air hunger. over the next few hospital days, an attempt was made to maintain the patients blood pressure at appropriate levels, however, inotropics were not to be used. the patient required increasing doses of morphine therapy, both for pain in her sacral decubitus wound as well as for increasing dyspnea and severe air hunger. the patient subsequently passed away on . her husband was present at the time and refused an autopsy at the time of death. the appropriate attending was notified and death certificate forms were filed with the admissions office. , m.d. dictated by: medquist36 d: 16:46 t:

four-quadrant ultrasound shows a trace of fluid only, the largest pocket been identified in the right lower quadrant. this is not suitable for planned paracentesis and no spot was marked. limited views of the liver show somewhat nodular outline consistent with cirrhosis. . liver us: pulsatile flow is demonstrated in the ivc and major hepatic veins. the portal vein and hepatic arteries are patent. the liver is shrunken and nodular, and ascites is present. the common bile duct is not dilated, a stone is present within the neck of the gallbladder. a 3.2-cm cyst is present in the right lobe, unchanged. impression: cirrhotic liver with ascites. patent portal and hepatic vessels . abd us: patent tips shunts with velocities ranging from 52-221 cmsec. the hepatic venous velocities are rather high and consequently a short-term followup study is recommended to reevaluate and exclude the possibility of stenosis at the hepatic venous stent. . rue us: right cephalic and brachial vein thrombosis. . echo: 1. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (ef75%). 2. there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. . cxr: endotracheal tube is approximately 3 cm above carina. ng tube is in body of stomach. left jugular cv line is in mid svc. no pneumothorax. right lateral chest is not included on the film. persistent opacity consistent with atelectasis in the left lower lobe is again demonstrated, slightly improved since prior film of same date. . ct ap: 1. cirrhotic liver with portal hypertension. 2. peripheral wedge-shaped hypoenhancing areas within the spleen, likely infarcts. 3. there are no focal enhancing liver lesions. 4. cholelithiasis. 5. tips in place.

left retrocardiac opacity. although possibly due to a combination of atelectasis and effusion, pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. 2. minimal hazy opacity in right upper lobe, for which an early focus of pneumonia is not excluded. . pfts: performed, report pending . liver us: there has been resolutionreabsorption of nearly all of the ascites and there is insufficient amount for ultrasound-guided paracentesis. . cxr: 1. persistent left pleural effusion and left retrocardiac opacity. although this may represent a combination of atelectasis and effusion, pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. 2. mild pulmonary interstitial edema. 3. no pneumothorax. . mandible xrpanorex: limited study. no evidence of fractures or gross bony abscess. further characterization of the dentition could be performed with a panorex view if clinically warranted. . colonoscopy: grade 1 external hemorrhoids, xanthomas in sigmoid (which were biopsied), other normal colonoscopy to cecum. brief hospital course: 51yo f w etoh cirrhosis, sp upper gib from esophageal varices. underwent banding and tips procedure. micu course complicated by hemolytic anemia due to incorrect blood type during transfusion, mrsa ventilator associated pneumonia, klebsiella sbp, and now acute renal failure likely due to cin. . resp: ms. was originally intubated for airway protection at the osh. after transfer here, while still intubated, she developed fevers and infiltrates on cxr. endotracheal specimen revealed mrsa. a bronchoscopy was performed and cultures revealed gpc and yeast. she was treated with vancomycin and was able to be extubated on . post-extubation, her respiratory status was stable. she had albuterol inhalers prn, but did not need them. she was able to use an incentive spirometer to help with her atelectasis. cxr showed a persistent retrocardiac opacity but she was afebrile and had no cough or sputum production, so antibiotics were never restarted. post-colonoscopy, she had decreased o2 sats but her cxr showed only mild volume overload, so it was felt to be most likely due to atelectasissedation from the procedure. . cv: ms. has no known cardiac history. ekg showed sinus tach, with twi in vi, tw flattening in iii, avf, but no st changes. her echo shows hyperdynamic walls, with ef 75%, but no wma. . id: ms. was febrile while in the micu and the source was not known. urine grew vre as well as yeast. yeast cultures were unable to be speciated. while in the micu, she had a picc line for access, but it appeared infected with presumed septic thrombi in superficial veins. blood cultures were negative. the picc line was removed and a left ij was placed instead. respiratory sources were considered, and she was treated with vancomycin for a mrsa ventilator-associated pneumonia. vancomycin was used from - , and was discontinued once she developed persistent renal failure. her cr became elevated to such an extent that her vancomycin was able to be dosed by level. other sources were felt to be possible sbp given that a peritoneal culture grew klebsiella. for that, she was treated with cefepime for 14 days ( - ). repeat paracentesis was considered, but follow-up ultrasound showed that there was no ascites. once she completed the course of cefepime, she was started on cipro per the liver team for sbp ppx. both pneumovax and dt were given on as her immunization status was unable to be obtained. she continued to have a retrocardiac opacity on cxr, but no signs or symptoms of pneumonia. stool cultures were negative for cdiff. . renal: ms. went into acute renal failure on , after undergoing a ct with contrast. renal consulted on the patient and felt that the most likely etiology to her acute renal failure was contrast induced nephropathy. hepatorenal syndrome was considered, but was less likely given that her urine lytes showed that she was not sodium avid. octreotide and midodrine were tried empirically, in case there was an element of hepatorenal syndrome, but there was no improvement in renal function with these medications so both were discontinued. a tunnelled hd line was placed on and hemodialysis was started on . on she underwent a combined liverrenal transplant. her renal graft began functioning soon after implantation. her creatinine trended down over time. . heme: on one transfusion, ms. was given incorrectly typed blood and developed hemolysis which likely decreased her hct and may have contributed to her jaundice. her hct reached a nadir of 23 on so she was given 1u prbc which increased her hct appropriately to 27. however, it continued to slowly trend down. she was given epogen at dialysis, but it appeared that she was not responding to epogen. during the course of her transplant she recieved 3 l of cell , 18 units of ffp, 10 units of cells, 5 platelets, and 5 cryo. she was also transfused on pod 1 with 4 prbcs, 2 fpp, and 4 platelets for her acute blood loss anemia. . . pancytopenia: this was felt to be due to a combination of marrow suppression from alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. her anemia was also likely due to her massive gi bleed, hemolytic anemia, and possibly renal failure. her thrombocytopenia was monitored daily and platelets were only transfused for bleeding or around times of procedures. on discharge her hematocrit, wbc, and platelet counts were stable and appropriate. . gi: ms. had a severe variceal bleed at the osh, requiring 5u prbc and 2u ffp. she underwent egd and banding at osh with repeat egd here (5 bands placed) as well as a tips procedure. she was followed by the liver team here and was placed on the transplant list. her meld score was 40 and she was given supportive care while waiting for a transplant. attempts were made to complete all testing prior to transplant. a dental evaluation was attempted on , but the patient was uanble to fully cooperate. a mammogram was scheduled for . equipment was needed in order to do a pap, but was unable to be obtained prior to her transplant. a pap from several years ago was negative. a colonoscopy was performed and was essentially normal. xanthomas were biopsied and removed, but the results were pending upon transfer to the surgery service. a liverrenal transplant became available to her on . please see the operative note for further details. the patient was taken intubed to the sicu from the or. she was extubated on pod 2. over time her lfts trended down and her encephalopathy cleared. on pod6 her t bili was acutely elevated and again rose to 20.8 on pod 7. an ercp was performed which demonstrated a stricture at the common bile duct anasotomosis. a stent was placed during this procedure. the following day her t bili was significantly decreased to 9.1 on dicharge her transaminases and t bili had normalized. . neuro: after being extubated and having her sedation weaned, her mental status continued to be waxing and . it was unclear if this was related to uremia andor encephalopathy (though she had no asterixis). she was continued on rifaximin and lactulose for prevention of encephalopathy. any medications which could be altering her mental status were discontinued. in the post-op period her encephalopathy cleared has her liver function improved. on discharge she was alert, oriented, understood why she had been hospitalized, and was able to take an active role in her care. she continued to learn about her medications and long-term needs. . endocrine: her hyperglycemia was likely due to her severe illness. her fingersticks were controlled with an insulin sliding scale. diabetes center consult was obtained post-opertively. intermittantly she was on an insulin drip. on dishcarge her blood glucose was controlled with glargine and iss. . fen: in the micu, while intubated, she was given nutrition via tube feeds in ogng tube. once she was extubated, she was able to take clears and her diet was advanced to solids upon transfer to the floor. she was given , renal diet with supplements. she was not given ivf on the floor as her kidney function was worsening and she was total body volume overloaded. her electrolytes were monitored daily and were repleted as needed to keep her k 4 and mg 2. post-operatively she was started on tpn on pod 1; however due to access issues as well as her ability to take pos this was discontinued on pod 4. on discharge she was tolerating a regular diet with good po intake. . access: she had a picc line originally in micu, but it was removed due to concerns about infection. a left ij was placed in the micu. a tunneled hd catheter was placed . the lij was removed in the sicu once it stopped functioning. she was maintained with peripheral access for the remainder of her hospitalization. . ppx: she was given pneumoboots for dvt prophylaxis (no heparin given her low platelets). she was also given a ppi q12. no bowel regimen was needed as she had profuse diarrhea. .

examination: on admission revealed normal vital signs, normal blood pressure and no fever. in general, he is an elderly white male in no acute distress. lungs are clear to auscultation. heart is regular, s1 and s2, 26 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border. abdomen soft, non distended, nontender. rectal is with frank melena, 2 edema bilaterally. neurologically is intact. laboratory

and minor diffuse st-t abnormalities, no change since . hospital course: 1. gi bleed: given the patients cirrhotic history and questionable esophageal varices, the patient was monitored very carefully in the icu for possible esophageal variceal bleed. his hematocrit was followed serially. his hemodynamics remained normal throughout his initial stay in the icu. he was transfused with four units of red cells initially with good response. he underwent upper endoscopy which at first was unrevealing. he was noted to have a slight drop in hematocrit over the next few days and was re-endoscoped. at that time bleeding gastric varices were seen although no esophageal varices were noted. the patient underwent banding of this gastric varices and was treated with propranolol as well as octreotide. he remained hemodynamically stable after this procedure. the next day he was hungry and requesting foods. he was able to tolerate clear liquids and after 24 hours of observation after his gastric variceal banding he was transferred out of the micu. the patient did well with a stable hematocrit and normal vital signs. on the next day he decompensated. at that time he was found unresponsive in his chair. a code was called and resuscitation was begun. initially the patient was pulseless, had no blood pressure. cpr was begun and patient was noted to vomit up large amounts of blood. the patient was intubated and venous access was obtained. he received aggressive blood resuscitation and with intubation and institution of cpr quickly gained his pulse and blood pressure. as his blood pressure remained low and he was intubated, he was transferred back to the micu. with surgical assistance as well as gi assistance, aggressive management was initiated for this gastric variceal bleed. the patient received aggressive blood transfusions approximately 16 units as well as several units of ffp. gastroenterology came and with surgical assistance tube was placed. the patients blood pressure was noted to be declining and pressor therapy was begun. upon the initial decompensation and the code, the health care proxy, fr. , was contact . fr. and patients other family membersfriends did come to the scene. after large volumes of blood had been given and patients hemodynamics remained poor as well as evidence of active bleeding, so discussion was held with fr. . at that time we had been hopeful that he would be able to go down for emergent tips but patient was too unstable. after discussion with fr. it was deemed that the patient would not have wanted these heroic measures taken. transfusion of blood products stopped. pressor support was stopped. at this time patient was breathing on his own although still intubated. the family members and friends were allowed to stay

history of present illness: 86-year-old woman w htn, hypothyroidism, aaa presents w shortness of breath x 1 day. she was in her usoh until 3 days ago, when she developed insidious onset of nasal congestion, runny nose, and cough occasionally productive of scant yellow sputum. she reports minor subjective fever initially that has resolved. these symptoms have persisted until now. over the past 2 days, she has developed increased dyspnea on exertion. there is no dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, or pnd. this morning, she had a prolonged episode of coughing which caused significant dyspnea, prompting her to call her pcp for advice. dr. was concerned about her dyspnea and advised her to present to the ed for evaluation. she denies any weight loss, chills, myalgias, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, black stools, dysuria, chest pain, or palpitations. she does report difficulty w balance over past months requiring her to use a cane for walking. in the ed, she was

definite evidence of more distal pulmonary embolus is visualized. 2. mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, including multiple subcentimeter pretracheal and precarinal nodes, and enlarged right hilar and subcarinal nodal masses. 3. four millimeter nodule within the left upper lobe laterally. comparison with any possibly available prior imaging is recommended. short-term ct follow-up is recommended. 4. bronchiectatic changes predominantly in the lower lobes bilaterally. 5. large hiatal hernia. : angiogram impression: 1. no evidence of active extravasation of the contrast material as above. 2. embolization of the left l3 lumbar artery per surgical team request. brief hospital course: 1. dyspnea: she was admitted w dyspnea in setting of uri symptoms that was most consistent w viral uri, as there was no fever and no infiltrative process on chest ct. she was tested for influenza w dfa of nasal aspirate. meanwhile, she was treated w ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover possible cap. on hd2, dfa returned as positive for influenza a. as the pt had been afebrile w no signs of infxn, pneumonia was thought to be unlikely and abx were dc at that time. she remained dyspnic w upper and lower airway wheezing throughout her early hospital course, which was thought to be viral bronchitis. she was treated w prednisone taper and nebulized albuterol and atrovent, w good symptom control. however, she required continued o2 by nc to maintain o2 sats 93% throughout the first half of her admission. by dc, she was weaned off o2 and was breathing comfortably on room air without requirement for albuterol or atrovent. at dc, she is maintaining good o2 sat on room air and is not dyspnic. 2. gi bleed: she was observed to have melanic stool in the ed, without any gi symptoms. she was guaiac positive at that time. this was most likely indolent upper gi bleed. on admission, coumadin was held and heparin was started for anticoagulation given her avr. treatment was started w iv protonix. plans were made for egdcolonoscopy to evaluate for source of bleeding, but these procedures were delayed due to the pts dyspnea and relative risk of sedation. her hct was observed to drop significantly, which was likely retroperitoneal bleed as below, and not related to gi bleed. after her admission, she had no further melena or hematochezia. after stabilization of retroperitoneal bleed, she underwent egd and colonoscopy, which demonstrated evidence of esophagitis w no active bleeding. protonix was changed to oral formulation, and sucralfate was added for improved treatment of esophagitis. she had no further evidence of active gi bleeding during her admission. her sucralfate was stopped. she will need to continue protonix twice daily after dc. 3. retroperitoneal hemorrhage: on hd4, her hct was observed to have dropped overnight from 27 to 21. this was concerning for active gi bleed. she was transfused w 2units prbcs, w appropriate hct increase to 29 after transfusion. however, her hct again decreased overnight from 29 to 22 with no melena or hematochezia to explain the blood loss. lab workup showed no evidence of hemolysis. abd ct demonstrated large left retroperitoneal hemorrhage, 11x5 cm in size, w radiographic evidence of acute on chronic bleeding. heparin was dc, she was transfused w an additional 2units prbcs, and was transferred to the micu for close monitoring. surgery was consulted, and recommended holding anticoagulation with close monitoring of hct. the pt had appropriate response of hct w prbc transfusion, and hct remained stable for 3 days off anticoagulation. as hct had stabilized, she was transferred back to the medicine floor and surgery recommended resuming heparin for anticoagulation. heparin was resumed w close monitoring of ptt, and hct was monitored closely. however, after resuming heparin the pt had another decrease in hct concerning for active bleeding. heparin was stopped immediately. repeat ct scan showed enlarging left retroperitoneal bleed tracking down into pelvis and left thigh. cta was done to localize source of bleed, and showed active contrast extravasation from the left l3 lumbar artery. ir was consulted, and performed embolization of left l3 lumbar artery, though there was no evidence of active bleeding from the artery at the time of the procedure. she tolerated the procedure well. hct was follow closely after embolization, and remained stable for 3 days. repeat cta showed no active bleeding from the l3 lumbar artery, which indicated a successful embolization. given this confirmation and stable hct, heparin was resumed w initial goal ptt of 40. hct was stable on this level of heparin, so heparin was increased to goal ptt of 60-70. the pt received 1 dose of coumadin 5mg to begin long-term anticoagulation. a ptt of 60 was achieved and was stable for 12 hours w stable hct, but the pt then developed abdominal distention and pain, w significant llqluq tenderness on exam. this was concerning for additional bleeding. heparin was once again dc, and repeat ct showed markedly enlarged retroperitoneal bleed displacing the left kidney and bowels to the right abdomen. surgery, ir, and vascular surgery were all consulted for recommendations on how to stop her bleeding. the consulting services all agreed that intervention was ill-advised, as surgical treatment was often inneffective and repeated arterial embolization in this setting might result in embolization of the wrong vessel, w possible bowel infarction or other complication. thus, the pt was given 2units ffp to reverse her inr of 1.3, and was transfused w 2units of prbcs. her hct did not respond appropriately to prbc transfusion, so she was transferred to the micu for close monitoring and continued transfusion. while in micu, anticoagulation continued to be held, and patient remained stable during micu course. indeed, it was felt that risks of bleeding outweighed need to anti-coagulation benefits. the patient was transferred to the floor with no further episodes of bleeding and a stable hematocrit for 72 hours by discharge. 4. htn: bp was acceptable on admission. bp meds were held initially given concern for gi bleed and subsequent retroperitoneal hemorrhage. however, bp was elevated within a few days of admission. when retroperitoneal bleed had initially stabilized, her outpt meds were resumed including diovan, hctz, and clonidine, resulting in good bp control. when her hematocrit began to drop for a second time and the patient was transferred back to the micu, her antihypertensives were again held. as her bleed stabilized, her blood pressures trended upward and she was restarted on diovan at 12 her home dose. her blood pressures should be followed at rehab. 5. anemia: she has ho iron deficiency anemia, w prior egd showing gastritis. hct on admission was slightly below baseline of 32-33. hct remained stable for initial hospital days, but dropped w retroperitoneal bleed as above. her hct was labile throughout her admission intermittent bleeding. at dc, there is no evidence of active bleeding. she will require fu of hct after dc to watch for further bleeding. 6. hypothyroidism: stable on synthroid during her admission. 7. avr: she has st. artificial aortic valve; requires anticoagulation w goal inr 2.5-3.5. inr subtherapeutic on admission. given melanic stool, we held coumadin on admission and started heparin for anticoagulation. she had intermittent retroperitoneal bleeding during her admission, requiring dc and resumption of heparin multiple times as above. given her repeated spontaneous bleeding after embolization of l3 lumber artery, we do not want to restart anticoagulation in the near future as the risk of ongoing bleeding is too great. 8. mediastinal lad: she has mediastinal lad, w largest node 3 x 2 cm by ct. this may represent lung ca given pulm nodule and smoking history. however, the pt wishes to defer further evaluation until active issues resolved. will follow w repeat ct 2 months after dc. 9. cystitis: she developed cystitis from yeast while using foley catheter, likely , as supported by pyuria and yeast in ucx. foley catheter was changed on discovery of yeast in urine, and she was treated w 7 day course of fluconazole. at dc, there is no evidence of active infection. medications on admission: 1. coumadin 6mg 6 days per week, 7mg 1 day per week 2. diovan 160mg qam 3. hctz 12.5mg q day 4. prevacid 5. synthroid 175mcg q day 6. clonidine 0.1mg discharge medications: 1. levothyroxine sodium 175 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily
